  -- Lemma 0: an inclusion relation exists and is unique
  --
  -- Such binary relation exists and is unique. Informally, 
  -- it exists because we can define it by the structural
  -- recursion-looking definition below. It is unique because 
  -- axioms (i)-(v) enforce a unique definition at each recursive 
  -- step below: they is only one possible way to define this 
  -- relation. This needs formal mathematical proof. 
  --
  -- Remark:
  -- One of the challenges is to prove that <= is reflexive
  -- and transitive. This seems surprisingly difficult as 
  -- any attempt to use structural induction for a proof
  -- seems to fail. There is a need to show other properties
  -- as well such as xUy == yUx (== being defined as <= and >=)
  -- 0Ux = x and xU(yUz) = (xUy)Uz, etc.
  --
  -- Definition: we define x == y as (x <= y && y <= x)
  --
  -- We do not know anything about == at this stage. One 
  -- succesful application of structural induction is
  -- as follows. We start with a definition:
  --
  -- Definition: We define the map E: X -> P(X) by:
  -- E(0) = 0 (the empty set)
  -- E({x}) = {x} (the singleton)
  -- E(aUb) = E(a)UE(b)
  -- informally, E(x) represents the 'elements' of x 
  -- (which is a subset of X). This is not quite true
  -- of course since various elements of E(x) could
  -- be equivalent with respect to ==. The breakthrough:
  -- Lemma 1: forall x,y:X we have x <= y if and only if:
  -- forall z:E(x) exists z':E(y), z == z'

elements :: Set -> [Set]
elements Empty         = []
elements (Singleton x) = [x]
elements (Union x y)   = elements x ++ elements y

  -- informally, this says that x is a subset of y iff
  -- every element of x is equivalent to an element of y.
  -- For once, structural induction seems to work. Proof:
  --
  -- x = 0. 0 <= y is always true. forall z:E(0) ... is 
  -- vacuously true. So equivalence is true when x = 0.
  --
  -- x = {x'}. We need to show that {x'} <= y is equivalent
  -- to the fact that forall z:E({x'})={x'}, there is z':E(y)
  -- such that z == z'. So we need to focus on the sub-Lemma
  --
  -- sub-Lemma: {x} <= y <=> exits z:E(y) x == z.
  --
  -- we shall do this by induction on y: 
  -- if y = 0, both sides of equivalence are always false.
  -- if y = {y'}. we need to show the equivalence
  -- {x} <= {y'} <=> x == y' which follows from property (iii)
  -- of the definition of <=.
  -- we now assume that y=aUb where a and b satisfy the induction
  -- hypothesis. We need to show {x} <= aUb <=> exists z:E(a)UE(b)
  -- such that x == z. From the induction hypothesis, we see that
  -- {x} <= a is equivalent to exists z:E(a) x == z, and similarly
  -- for b. So we need to show the equivalence {x} <= aUb <=>
  -- {x} <= a || {x} <= b  which is true by virtue of property 
  -- (iv) of the definition of <=. This completes the proof
  -- of the sub-lemma and the case x = {x'} of the lemma.
  --
  -- x = aUb, where a and b satisfy the induction hypothesis.
  -- we need to show that aUb <= y is equivalent to 
  -- for all z:E(a)UE(b) there is z':E(y), z == z'.
  -- However, from the induction hypothesis we see that
  -- a <= y is equivalent to forall z:E(a) there is z':E(y), 
  -- z == z', and similarly for b. So we have to prove the 
  -- equivalence aUb <= y <=> a <= y && b <= y which is true 
  -- from (v) of the definition of <=. This completes the proof.
  --
  -- Definition: we define order: X -> N as follows:
  -- order(0) = 1
  -- order({x}) = 1 + order(x)
  -- order(xUy) = 1 + max(order(x), order(y))
  --
  -- Lemma 2: forall x:X and z:E(x), order(z) < order(x)
  --
  -- by induction on x. If x = 0, E(0) is empty and the property
  -- is vacuously true. if x = {x'} then z:E(x) is z=x' and we
  -- have order(x') < order(x) by definition of order.
  -- if x = aUb where a, b satisfy the induction hypothesis and
  -- if z:E(x), then z:E(a) or z:E(b). in the first case, from
  -- the induction hypothesis we obtain order(z) < order(a)
  -- and in the second case order(z) < order(b). The result follows
  -- from order(a), order(b) < order(x).
  --
  -- We are now able to handle reflexivity of <=.
  --
  -- Lemma 3: the relation <= on X is reflexive
  --
  -- We proceed to prove x <= x by induction on order(x).
  -- If order(x) = 1, then x can only be 0 and 0 <= 0 is true.
  -- We assume the property is true for order(x) <= N >=1
  -- We need to show it is true for order(x) <= N+1. We 
  -- may assume that order(x) = N+1. We need to show that
  -- x <= x. Using Lemma 1, it is sufficient to show that
  -- for all z:E(x) we have z == z (which is z <= z).
  -- However from Lemma 2 we see that any such z is such that
  -- order(z) < order(x). In particular, order(z) <= N and the
  -- property z <= z follows from the induction hypothesis.
  --
  -- Lemma 4: forall x y:X, x <= xUy
  --
  -- Applying Lemma 1, it is sufficient to show that for all
  -- z:E(x) there is z':E(x)UE(y), z == z'. Hence it is 
  -- sufficient to prove that z == z for all z:E(x), which
  -- we know is true by reflexivity of Lemma 3.
  --
  -- Lemma 5: forall x y:X, xUy == yUx
  --
  -- Also follows immediately from Lemma 1 and reflexivity
  --
  -- Lemma 6: forall x y z:X, (xUy)Uz == xU(yUz)
  --
  -- idem
  --
  -- Lemma 7: forall x:X, xU0 == x
  --
  -- idem
  --
  -- And now the big prize:
  --
  -- Lemma 8: the relation <= on X is transitive
  --
  -- We shall prove the implication (x <= y)/\(y <= z) -> (x <= z)
  -- by induction on the maximum order of x, y and z. If the order
  -- of x,y,z are all less than 1, then x = y = z = 0 and the
  -- property is true. So we assume that the property is true
  -- whenever the orders of x,y,z are all less than (or equal to) N.
  -- We need to show the property is true whenever the orders
  -- of x,y,z are all less than N+1 (or equal). So let's assume this is the 
  -- case and that x <= y together with y <= z. We need to show that
  -- x <= z. Using Lemma 1, given u:E(x) we need to show the 
  -- existence of w:E(z) such that u == w. However from x <= y
  -- there exists v:E(y) such that u == v, and from y <= z, 
  -- there exists w:E(z) such that v == w. However, from Lemma 2
  -- the orders of u,v,w are all less than (or equal to) N. From 
  -- the induction hypothesis, u == v and v == w we can conclude
  -- that u == w which completes the proof of the lemma.
  --
  -- Lemma 9: the relation == on X is a congruence.
  --
  -- First we show it is an equivalence relation. Being defined
  -- as x == y iff (x <= y)/\(y <= x), it is clearly symmetric.
  -- Furthermore, it is reflexive from Lemma 3 and transitive
  -- from Lemma 8. We now show that == is compatible with the
  -- operators of the free algebra (X, 0, {}, U). We have 0 == 0.
  -- We assume that x == y. We need to show that {x} == {y}. This
  -- follows immediately from (iii) of the definition of <= 
  -- which states that {x} <= {y} is equivalent to x == y.
  -- We know assume that x == x' and y == y'. We need to show 
  -- that xUy == x'Uy'. It is sufficient to prove that 
  -- xUy <= x'Uy' follows from x <= x' and y <= y'. Using (v)
  -- of the definition of <=, it is sufficient to prove that 
  -- x <= x'Uy' and y <= x'Uy', and since xUy commutes modulo 
  -- == (by Lemma 5), it is sufficient to establish the following
  --
  -- Lemma 10: for all x x' y:X, if x <= x' then xUy <= x'Uy 
  -- 
  -- Applying Lemma 1, given z in E(xUy) = E(x)UE(y), we need
  -- to show the existence of z' in E(x')UE(y) such that 
  -- z == z' If z is in E(y) we can take z'=z and we are done
  -- since == is reflexive. If z is in E(x), from x <= x' we 
  -- obtain the existence of z' in E(x') such that z == z'. So 
  -- we are also done in this case.
  --
  --
  -- Lemma 11: The relation <= on X is compatible with ==.
  --
  -- That is if x == x' and y == y' and x <= y, then we 
  -- must have x' <= y'. This follows immediately from
  -- the transitivity of <= (Lemma 8)
  --
  --
  -- Definition: We can now define the quotient space X/==
  -- which will shall denote X* or (X*,0, {}, U), on which
  -- the inclusion <= is well defined (Lemma 11).
  --
  -- Lemma 12: for all x y:X* we have x=y iff (x<=y)/\(y<=x)
  --
  -- This seems pretty obvious, let us make sure we get it
  -- formally right. For the purpose of the proof, given 
  -- x y in X, we denote [x] and [y] the elements of X* 
  -- representing the classes of x and y modulo == respectively.
  -- we need to show that [x]=[y] iff ([x]<=[y])/\([y]<=[x]).
  -- but [x]=[y] is equivalent to x == y and [x]<=[y] is (by
  -- definition) equivalent to x <= y. So we are done.
  --
  -- Lemma 13: The relation <= on X* is a partial order.
  --
  -- Since [x]<=[y] is defined as x<=y (definition which is
  -- legitimate by Lemma 11), we immediately see that <=
  -- is reflexive and transitive. It remains to show that
  -- it is also symmetric. But [x]<=[y] and [y]<=[x] imply
  -- that x == y and consequently [x]=[y].
  --
  -- Just like we did for X we can define for X* the notion
  -- of a 'set's elements':
  --
  -- Definition: We define the map E*: X* -> P(X*) by:
  -- E*([0])   = 0         (the empty set) 
  -- E*({[x]}) = {[x]}     (the singleton)
  -- E*([a]U[b])   = E*([a])UE*([b]) (the union)
  --
  -- Warning: beware that given x in X or X*, the notation {x}
  -- is ambiguous (overloaded), as it may refer to the set
  -- theoretic singleton {x} (set with unique element x) or to the 
  -- value obtainied by applying the unary operator {} on x.
  --
  -- There is a natural relationship between E* and E:
  --
  -- Lemma 14: forall x:X, E*([x]) = { [y] | y:E[x] } 
  -- 
  -- Proof by structural induction.
  --
  -- In other words the elements of the class of x, are
  -- the classes of the elements of x.
  --
  -- Definition: given x y:X we say that x belongs to y,
  -- denoted x in y or x:y, if and only {x} <= y.


  -- Lemma 15: the 'belong' (':' , 'in') relation on X
  -- is compatible with the congruence == on X, in other
  -- words, if x == x' and y == y' and x:y, then x':y'
  --
  -- Proof: we need to show that {x'} <= y', but == being
  -- a congruence we have {x'} == {x} and the result follows
  -- immediately by transitivity.
  --
  -- We can therefore extend the relation belong to the 
  -- quotient algebra X* by defining [x]:[y] iff x:y.
  --
  -- We now have the interesting lemma:
  --
  -- Lemma 16: for all x y:X*, x:y <=> x:E*(y)
  --
  -- Be careful that the above 'x:y' refers to the quotient
  -- binary relation ':' on X*, while 'x:E*(y)' refers to the
  -- usual set theoretic 'x is an element of the set E*(y)'.
  -- The set E*(y) is supposed to represents of the elements
  -- of X* which are 'element' of y. So Lemma 16 should be
  -- true, or something is wrong with the whole thing, or
  -- with the definition of ':' or with that of E*.
  --
  -- Proof: in order to be totally formal, we shall keep
  -- the notations [x] and [y] to distinguish elements of X
  -- from their corresponding classes in X*.
  --
  -- We need to show that [x]:[y] <=> [x]:E*([y]). However,
  -- [x]:[y] is defined as x:y which is itself defined 
  -- as {x} <= y. By Lemma 1, this is equivalent to the fact
  -- for all z in E({x}) = {x}, there should be z' in E(y)
  -- such that z == z'. In brief, [x]:[y] is equivalent 
  -- to the existence of z in E(y) such that x == z.
  -- Now from lemma 14, [x]:E*([y]) is equivalent to 
  -- [x] = [z] for some z in E(y). Hence it is also equivalent
  -- to the existence of z in E(y) such that x == z. We done.
  --
  -- Lemma 17: forall x y:X*, x <= y <=> E*(x) <= E*(y)
  -- 
  -- (E*(x) <= E*(y) refers to the usual set theoretic inclusion)
  -- Formally given x y:X we need to show that [x] <= [y] (which
  -- is equivalent to x <= y) is equivalent to E*([x]) <= E*([y]).
  -- First we prove =>. So we assume that x <= y, and we assume
  -- that [z] in E*([x]). We need to show that [z] in E*([y]).
  -- From Lemma 14, there is z1 in E(x) such that z == z1. 
  -- However from Lemma 1 and x <= y, there is z2 in E(y)
  -- such that z1 == z2. Hence by transitivity, there is z2 
  -- in E(y) such that z == z2. This shows from Lemma 14 that
  -- [z] in E*([y]) as requested. We now prove <=. So we assume
  -- that the inclusion E*([x]) <= E*([y]) holds and we need to
  -- show that x <= y. We shall use Lemma 1 so we assume that
  -- z in E(x). We need to show the existence of z' in E(y) 
  -- such that z == z' However from z in E(x) and Lemma 14 we obtain
  -- [z] in E*([x]) and from the assumed inclusion it follows that
  -- [z] in E*([y]). Using Lemma 14 once again, we see that 
  -- z == z' for some z' in E(y), we completes the proof.
  --
  --
  --Lemma 18: forall x y:X*, we have the equivalence:
  --  x <= y  <=> forall z:X*, z:x -> z:y
  --
  -- In other words, on the quotient algebra X*, the binary 
  -- relation <= truly behaves as in inclusion relation with
  -- respect to the belong relation ':', which is what we want.
  --
  -- Proof: 
  -- By virtue of Lemma 17, x <= y is equivalent to the
  -- inclusion E*(x) <= E*(y). However, from Lemma 16,
  -- given z:X*, z:x is equivalent to z:E*(x). Hence 
  -- we have to prove that the inclusion is equivalent to
  --  forall z:X*, z:E*(x) -> z:E*(y)
  -- which is indeed the case. 
  --
  -- Somehow we feel that an element of X* refers to a real set
  -- in the world of ZF. We are tempted to define a map F with 
  -- domain X* by the following structural recursion:
  --
  --  (i)   F(0) = 0              (the empty set)
  --  (ii)  F({x}) = {F(x)}       (the set with one element)
  --  (iii) F(xUy) = F(x)UF(y)    (the usual set theoretic union)
  --
  -- Remark: we dropped the formal notation [x] in the previous
  -- definition, so 0 here denotes the element [0] of X* etc
  --
  -- but this would be a gross mistake as structural induction
  -- definition are only legitimate for free algebras. So we shall
  -- define F on X instead and show it is compatible with ==.
  --
  -- Definition: we define the map F with domain X as follows:
  --
  --  (i)   F(0) = 0              (the empty set)
  --  (ii)  F({x}) = {F(x)}       (the set with one element)
  --  (iii) F(xUy) = F(x)UF(y)    (the usual set theoretic union)
  --
  -- Remark: The formal justification of the existence of the
  -- map F from the axioms of ZF is required. This is a slightly
  -- more difficult case than usual as we do not have an obvious
  -- set to work with as the range of F.
  --
  -- Remark: do not confuse F(x) with E(x) eventhough the 
  -- definitions of F and E are very similar. Given x:X,
  -- E(x) is a subset of X. It is a set of formal expression.
  -- F(x) is not a subset of X. It is simply a set which is
  -- the value of the expression x in the world of sets. For 
  -- example, if we consider the element 1 = {0} of X. It is a
  -- formal expression, and F(1) = 1 (the set theoretic singleton 
  -- {0}). We have E(1) = {0}, the singleton containing the element 
  -- 0 of X.
  -- 
  -- Remark: With a bit of work, using the ZF axiom schema of
  -- replacement, we should be about to justify the fact that
  -- the range F(X) is a well defined set. Hence we have a
  -- map F: X -> F(X). This map is compatible with ==.
  --
  -- Lemma 19: forall x:X, F(x) = { F(z) | z:E(x) }
  --
  -- Proof: by structural induction. Since both F(0) and E(0)
  -- are empty sets, the equality is true when x = 0. Since
  -- F({x})={F(x)} (the singleton with unique element F(x)),
  -- and E({x}) = {x} (the singleton with unique element x:X),
  -- the equality is true in the case {x}. So we assume that
  -- x = aUb where a b:X are such that the equality is true.
  -- We need to show it is also true for x:
  --
  -- F(x) = F(aUb) = F(a)UF(b) = {F(z)|z:E(a)}U{F(z):z:E(b)}
  --      = {F(z)|z:E(a)UE(b)} = {F(z)|z:E(x)} 
  -- so we are done.
  --
  -- Lemma 20: The map F: X -> F(x) is compatible with ==, i.e.
  -- for all x y:X we have have the implication:
  --
  --            x == y -> F(x) = F(y)
  -- 
  -- Proof: by induction on the order of x and y. If both the
  -- order of x and y are 1, then x = y = 0 and the implication
  -- is clearly true. So we assume the implication is true
  -- whenever both the order of x and y are <= N (for N>= 1).
  -- We need to show the implication is also true whenever
  -- x and y have orders <= N+1. So let us assume this is the
  -- case and furthermore that x == y. We need to show that
  -- F(x) = F(y). First we show the inclusion F(x) <= F(y).
  -- Given u in F(x), we need to show that u:F(y). However
  -- by Lemma 19, u = F(z) for some z:E(x). From the assumption
  -- x == y, in particular we have x <= y, and using Lemma 1
  -- together with z:E(x), we see that there exists z' in E(y)
  -- such that z == z'. From Lemma 2, order(z) < order(x) and
  -- order(z') < order(y). It follows that both the orders of
  -- z and z' are <= N. From our induction hypothesis together
  -- with z == z', we obtain F(z) = F(z'). Hence we see that
  -- u = F(z') for some z':E(y). We conclude from Lemma 19 that
  -- u belongs to F(y) which completes the proof of F(x) <= F(y).
  -- The proof of F(y) <= F(x) is handled identically. 
  --
  -- We are now able to define F on the domain X* rather than X
  --
  -- Definition: we can define F*:X* -> F(X) by F([x]) = F(x)
  --
  -- By Lemma 20, this definition is legitimate.
  --
  -- Lemma 21: forall x y:X*, we have:
  --
  --  (i)   F*(0) = 0               (the empty set)
  --  (ii)  F*({x}) = {F*(x)}       (the set with one element)
  --  (iii) F*(xUy) = F*(x)UF*(y)   (the usual set theoretic union)
  --
  -- Remark: in (i), it is understood that the LHS '0' refers to
  -- the element [0] of X*, namely the equivalence class of 0 mod ==
  --
  -- Proof: F*([0]) = F(0) = 0
  --        F*({[x]}) = F*([{x}]) = F({x}) = {F(x)} = {F*([x])}
  --        F*([x]U[y]) = F*([xUy]) = F(xUy) = F(x)UF(y) = F*([x])UF*([y])
  --
  -- Lemma 22: the map F*: X* -> F*(X*)=F(X) is a bijection
  --
  -- So this is like saying that we have defined a universe of
  -- sets F(X), for which we have an exact representation as
  -- and algebraic data type (except maybe that algebraic data
  -- type corresponds to the notion of free universal algebra,
  -- and our algebra X* is not free, as it is a quotient algebra). 
  --
  -- Proof: we need to show the implication for all x y:X*,
  --   F*(x) = F*(y) -> x = y
  -- or equivalently that for all x y:X,
  --  F(x) = F(y) -> x == y
  -- which is the reverse implication as that of Lemma 20.
  -- We shall prove this implication by induction of the order
  -- of x and y in similar fashion to what was done for Lemma 20
  -- if the order of x and y is 1, then x = y = 0 and the implication
  -- is clearly true. So we assume the implication is true whenever
  -- the order of x and y are both <= N. We need to show it is still
  -- true whenever the order of x and y are both <= N+1. So we assume
  -- the is the case and furthermore that F(x) = F(y). We need to 
  -- show that x == y. First we show that x <= y. Using Lemma 1,
  -- given z:E(x) we need to show the existence of z':E(y) such that
  -- z == z'. However from Lemma 19 and z:E(x) we see that F(z):F(x).
  -- Hence, from the assumption F(x)=F(y) we see that F(z):F(y) and
  -- applying Lemma 19 once more, F(z)=F(z') for some z':E(y). It 
  -- remains to show that z == z'. However from Lemma 2 we have 
  -- order(z) < order(x) and order(z') < order(y). So both the 
  -- order of z and z' are <= N and we have F(z)=F(z'). From our
  -- induction hypothesis it follows that z == z' which completes
  -- the proof of x <= y. The proof of y <= x is identical. 
  --
  -- In fact, given Lemma 21 and Lemma 22, F*: X* -> F(X) is an
  -- isomorphism between the algebras (X*,0,{},U) and (F(X),0,{},U),
  -- where 0, {}, U on F(X) are the usual set-theoretic operators
  -- (F(X) is clearly closed for those operators) 
  --
  -- It is quite nice that we have an algebra of sets (F(X),0,{},U)
  -- which is a mathematical object, which is isomorphic to another
  -- algebra (X*,0,{},U) (another mathematical object), where the
  -- latter has an obvious computing representation as an algebraic
  -- data type modulo the equivalence ==.
  --

  -- We now need to introduce a new notion which is similar to that
  -- of 'order' but different. We call it 'rank'
  --
  -- Definition: we define rnk: X -> N by induction:
  -- rnk(0)   = 0
  -- rnk({x}) = 1 + rnk(x)
  -- rnk(aUb) = max(rnk(a),rnk(b))

rank :: Set -> Integer
rank Empty          = 0
rank (Singleton x)  = 1 + rank x
rank (Union x y)    = max (rank x) (rank y)

  -- Lemma 23: for all x:X we have:
  --
  --  rnk(x) = max{ 1 + rnk(z) | z:E(x) }
  --
  -- with the convention that max(0) = 0 
  -- Proof: by structural induction. Since E(0) = 0 and max(0) = 0
  -- the property is true for x = 0. Since E({x}) = {x}, it is also
  -- clearly true for {x}. We now assume that x=aUb where a b:X are
  -- such that the equality is true. Then we have:
  --
  -- rnk(x) = max(rnk(a),rnk(b))
  --        = max(max{1+rnk(z)|z:E(a)}, max{1+rnk(z)|z:E(b)})
  --        = max{1+rnk(z)|z:E(a)UE(b)}
  --        = max{1+rnk(z)|z:E(x)}
  -- This completes the proof of the lemma.
  --
  -- The 'rank' is an interesting notion because it is compatible with
  -- the congruence ==, contrary to the notion of 'order' (which is still
  -- of value for various unductiove arguments) :
  --
  -- Lemma 24: forall x y:X we have the implication:
  --
  --  x == y  -> rnk(x) = rnk(y)
  --
  -- Proof: We shall prove this result by induction on the rank of 
  -- x and y. First we assume that the rank of x and y is 0. Then
  -- the implication is clearly true. So we assume that the implication
  -- is true whenever x and y have rank <= N for a given N>=1. We need
  -- to show that it is still true whenever the rank of x and y are 
  -- <= N+1. so we assume this is the case and furthermore that 
  -- x == y. We need to show that rnk(x) = rnk(y). However let z:E(x).
  -- Since x == y, in particular x <= y and by Lemma 1 there exists
  -- z':E(y) such that z == z'. However by Lemma 23, we see that the
  -- rnk(z) < rnk(x) and rnk(z') < rnk(y). It follows that both the
  -- rank of z and z' are <= N. From z == z' and the induction hypothesis
  -- we obtain rnk(z) = rnk(z'). Hence from Lemma 23 we have:
  --  1 + rnk(z) = 1 + rnk('z) <= rnk(y)
  -- This being true for all z:E(x), we conclude that rnk(x)<=rnk(y).
  -- We prove similarly that rnk(y) <= rnk(x).

  -- Thanks to Lemma 24, the notion of rank can be extended to the
  -- quotient algebra X* with the following definition:
  --
  -- Definition: we define rnk* : X* -> N by setting rnk*([x]) = rnk(x).
  -- 
  -- Definition: forall n:N we define X*n = {x:X* | rnk(x) <= n}.
  --
  -- Lemma 25: X*0  = {0}
  --
  -- Proof: in this lemma {0} refers to the singleton comprised of the
  -- element 0 of X* (where 0 = [0], the equivalence class of 0:X modulo
  -- == ). The symbol '0' is overloaded, but nothing too confusing here.
  -- By definition, we do have rnk(0) = 0. So 0 belongs to X*0. It remains
  -- to show the implication rnk(x) = 0 -> x = 0 (in X*). So suppose x:X*
  -- and rnk(x) = 0. Let's denote x by [x] where x is a representative of
  -- its class. Then rnk(x) = 0 and from Lemma 23, it follows that E(x) = 0. 
  -- From Lemma 14 we obtain E*([x]) = 0 and finally from Lemma 17 we 
  -- conclude that [x] = 0 as required.
  --
  -- Lemma 26: X*1 = {0,1} (where 1:X* is defined as 1 = {0}).
  --
  -- Proof: it is clear that rnk(0) <= 1 and rnk(1) <= 1. So it remains
  -- to show the implication rnk(x) <= 1 -> x = 0 or x = 1. So we assume
  -- that rnk(x) <= 1. If rnk(x) = 0, from Lemma 25 we already know that 
  -- x = 0 and we are done. So we assume that rnk(x) = 1. Let us denote
  -- x by [x], where x:X is a representative of the class of x mod ==.
  -- Then rnk(x) = 1 and from Lemma 23, it follows that rnk(z) = 0 for
  -- all z:E(x). Hence we see from Lemma 25 that [z] = 0. This being 
  -- true for all z:E(x) and since E(x) in not empty (rnk(x) = 1), we
  -- obtain from Lemma 14 that E*([x]) = {0} = E*({0}). From Lemma 17
  -- we conlude that [x] = {0} = 1 as requested.  
  -- 
  -- Lemma 27: X*2 = {0,1,{1},2} (where 2:X* is defined as {0}U{1})
  -- 
  -- Proof: we have rnk(0) = 0 <= 2 and rnk(1) = 1 <= 2. Furthermore,
  -- rnk({1}) = 1 + rnk(1) = 2 <= 2 and rnk(2) = max(rnk(1), rnk({1}))
  -- so rnk(2) = 2 <= 2. So it remains to show the implication for x:X*
  -- rnk(x) <= x = 0 or x = 1 or x = {1} or x = 2. So we assume that
  -- rnk(x) <= 2 in which case rnk(z) <= 1 for all z:E*(x). So E*(x)
  -- must be a subset of {0,1}. By Lemma 17, E*(x) = 0 implies x = 0,
  -- E*(x) = {0} implies x = {0} = 1, E*(x) = {1}) implies x = {1}, and
  -- E*(x) = {0,1} implies x = {0,1} = 2. 
  --
  -- By Lemma 17, we know that the map E*:X* -> P(X*) is injective. A
  -- simple induction shows that E*(x) is a finite subset of X* for all
  -- x:X*, so we cannot expect this map to be surjective (even forgetting
  -- about Cantor). However, given *finite* subset A of X* we can easily
  -- guess that E*(x) = A for some x:X*. Informally, if A = {x0,..,xk}
  -- then x = {x0}U...U{xk}.
  --  
  -- Lemma 28: Let A be a finite subset of X*. exists! x:X*, E*(x) = A.
  --
  -- Proof. The uniquess follows from injectivity. In order to prove the
  -- existence, we shall proceed with an induction on the cardinal |A| of
  -- A. If |A| = 0, i.e. A = 0, then A = E*(0) and the property is true.
  -- We assume the property is true whenever |A| = n (given n >=0). We
  -- need to show it is also true when |A| = n + 1. so let us assume
  -- this is the case. In particular A is not empty and we can consider
  -- some a:A and define B = A\{a}. Then |B| = n and from the induction
  -- hypothesis, there is x0:X* such that B = E*(x0). Define x = {a}Ux0
  -- Then we have E*(x) = A as requested.
  --
  -- Lemma 29: Given n>=1, the restriction of E* to X*n defines a 
  -- bijection between X*n and P(X*(n-1)).
  -- 
  -- Proof: We already know that E* is injective, and the same apply
  -- to it restriction to X*n. Given x:X*n, we first need to justify
  -- the fact that E*(x) is indeed a subset of X*(n-1), so that E* 
  -- restricted to X*n does indeed define a map X*n -> P(X*(n-1)).
  -- So let y:E*(x). We need to show that rnk(y) <= n-1. However
  -- from Lemma 14 we know that y = [z] for some z:E(x). From Lemma 23
  -- we have 1+rnk(z) <= rnk(x) <= n (slight abuse of notation where
  -- x denotes a representative of the class of x...). Hence we see
  -- that rnk(y)= rnk(z) <= n-1 as requested. It remains to show that
  -- the map X*n -> P(X*(n-1)) is surjective. Since we have an 
  -- injection X*n -> P(X*(n-1)), a simple induction on n shows that
  -- X*n is a finite subset of X* for all n:N. So let A be a subset of
  -- X*(n-1). Then in particular, A is a finite subset of X*. Applying
  -- Lemma 28, there exists some x:X* such that E*(x) = A. From Lemma 23
  -- and Lemma 14, we easily see that rnk(x) <= n, i.e. x:X*n. This 
  -- shows that E*:X*n->P(X*(n-1)) is a surjective map as requested 
  --
  -- A consequence of Lemma 29 is that we are able to compute the cardinal
  -- of X*n for all n>=0. Since X*0 = {0}, |X*0| = 1. We also know that
  -- X*1 = {0,1} and |X*1| = 2 = 2^1. We also know that X*2 = {0,1,{1},2}
  -- and |X*2| = 4 = 2^|X*1|. Then |X*3| = 2^4 = 16 and |X*4| = 2^16 etc. 
  -- 
  -- Definition: given n:N we define the map h(n):X*n->N with an induction
  -- on n:N. First we define h(0):X*0->N by setting h(0)(0) = 0. Next, 
  -- assuming n >= 1 and h(n-1) is defined, we define h(n):X*n->N by:
  --
  -- h(n)(x) = sum { 2^h(n-1)(z) | z:E*(x) }
  --
  -- Note that this sum is well defined: first, given x:X*n, the set E*(x)
  -- is a finite set so h(n)(x) is defined in terms of a finite sum. 
  -- Furthermore, by Lemma 29, E*(x) is a subset of X*(n-1) and consequently,
  -- given z:E*(x), the quantity h(n-1)(z) is a well-defined natural number.
  --
  -- to build an intuitive sense of the h(n)'s let us compute a few values:
  --
  -- h(0): X*0 = {0} -> N
  -- h(0)(0) = 0
  --
  -- h(1): X*1 = {0,1} -> N
  -- h(1)(0) = sum {...| z:E*(0) } = 0 since E*(0) = 0
  -- h(1)(1) = h(1)({0}) = sum { ... |z:{0} } = 2^h(0)(0) = 2^0 = 1
  --
  -- h(2): X*2 = {0,1,{1},2} -> N
  -- h(2)(0) = sum {...| z:E*(0) } = 0 since E*(0) = 0
  -- h(2)(1) = h(2)({0}) = 2^h(1)(0) = 2^0 = 1
  -- h(2)({1}) = sum { ... | z:E*({1}) } = sum{ ... | z:{1} } = 2^h(1)(1) = 2^1 = 2
  -- h(2)(2) = h(2)({0,1}) = sum{...| z:{0,1}} = 2^h1(0) + 2^h1(1) = 2^0 + 2^1 = 3
  --
  -- The elements of X*3 are as follows, with corresponding values of h(3)
  --
  -- 0            -> 0   
  -- 1            -> 1
  -- {1}          -> 2
  -- 2            -> 3
  -- {{1}}        -> 4  2^h(2)({1}) = 2^2
  -- {0,{1}}      -> 5  2^h(2)(0) + 2^h(2)({1}) = 2^0 + 2^2
  -- {1,{1}}      -> 6  2^h(2)(1) + 2^h(2)({1}) = 2^1 + 2^2
  -- {0,1,{1}}    -> 7  2^h(2)(0) + 2^h(2)(1) + 2^h(2)({1}) = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2
  -- {2}          -> 8  2^h(2)(2) = 2^3
  -- {0,2}        -> 9  2^0 + 2^3
  -- {1,2}        -> 10 2^1 + 2^3
  -- 3            -> 11 (3:X* defined as 2U{2} '=' {0,1,2}) -> 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3
  -- {{1},2}      -> 12 2^2 + 2^3
  -- {0,{1},2}    -> 13 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3
  -- {1,{1},2}    -> 14 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^2
  -- {0,1,{1},2}  -> 15 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3
  --
  -- What is interesting about the functions h(n):X*n->N is that they are extensions
  -- of each other, i.e. h(p):X*p->N coincide with h(n) on X*n for n <= p. We can 
  -- see this with the above numbers and:
  --
  -- h(0)(0) = h(1)(0) = h(2)(0) = h(3)(0) = 0
  -- h(1)(1) = h(2)(1) = h(3)(1) = 1
  -- h(2)({1}) = h(3)({1}) = 2
  -- h(2)(2)   = h(3)(2)   = 3
  --
  -- Lemma 30: for all n p:N with n <= p, for all x:X*n, h(n)(x) <= h(p)(x)
  --
  -- Proof: it is sufficient to prove that for all n>=1 and x:X*n we have
  -- h(n)(x) = h(n+1)(x). Since h(0)(0) = 0 = h(1)(0), the property is true
  -- for n = 0. So let us assume it is true for n >= 0. We need to show it
  -- is also true for n+1. So let x:X*(n+1). We need to show the equality
  -- h(n+1)(x) = h(n+2)(x) which goes as follows:
  --
  -- h(n+2)(x)  = sum{ 2^h(n+1)(z) | z:E*(x) } 
  --            = sum{ 2^h(n)(z)   | z:E*(x) } (IH, z:E*(x) -> z:X*n)
  --            = h(n+1)(x)
  --
  -- By virtue of Lemma 30, therefore able to define a function h:X*->N as follows:
  --
  -- Definition: We define h:X*->N by setting h(x) = h(n)(x) for rnk(x) <= n.
  --
  -- Our next challenge is to prove that the function h:X*->N is actually a bijection.
  --
  -- Definition: for n:N we call cardinal of rank n , the number c(n) define by:
  --
  --    c(0) = 1, c(n+1) = 2^c(n)
  --
  -- These numbers are important, as they correspond to the cardinal of X*n:
  --
  -- Lemma 31: for all n:N, |X*n| = c(n)
  --
  -- Proof: Since X*0 = {0} , we have |X*0| = 1 = c(0). Furthermore, by Lemma 29,
  -- X*(n+1) is in bijection with P(X*n). So |X*(n+1)| = 2^|X*n|. Hence we obtain
  -- |X*n| = c(n) for all n:N by a simple induction argument.
  --
  -- Given n:N, the notation 2^n is ambiguous: on the one hand, it may refer to the
  -- set of maps k:n->2. On the other hand, it may refer to the integer 2^n.
  -- Let us assume that 2^n refers to a set of maps. Then there is an obvious bijection
  -- between P(n) (set of subsets of n = {0,1,..,n-1}) and 2^n. If we denote the integer
  -- 2^n by (2^n)', then there is also a bijection f:2^n -> (2^n)' defined by:
  --
  --    f(x) = sum { x(i)2^i | i:n }
  --
  -- The map x:n->2 is interpreted as a binary representation and converted into a number
  -- which lies in the set (2^n)' = {0,1,...,(2^n)' - 1}
  --
  -- It follows that for all n:N, the map f:P(n)->(2^n)' defined by 
  --
  --  f(A) = sum { 1_A(i)2^i | i:n } = sum { 2^i | i:A }  (2^i denotes integer, not map)
  --
  --  is a bijection. Let us now revert to the notation 2^n as an integer.
  --
  --
  -- Lemma 32: let X is a finite set and h:X->|X| be an arbitrary bijection between the set
  -- X and its integer cardinal |X|. Then f: P(X) -> 2^|X| = { 0,1, ... , 2^|X|-1 }
  --
  --  f(A) = sum { 2^h(i) | i:A }
  --
  -- is a bijection.
  --
  -- Proof: from our previous discussion, we have identified the bijection g:P(|X|)->2^|X|
  -- defined by g(B) = sum { 2^i | i:B }. Now the bijection h:X->|X| induces an obvious
  -- bijection H:P(X)->P(|X|) defined by H(A) = {h(i) | i:A} (usually denoted h(A) or h[A])
  -- Hence we have a bijection goH : P(X)->2^|X| and it remains to show that goH = f. So
  -- let A be a subset of X, then we have:
  --
  -- f(A) = sum { 2^h(i) | i:A } = sum { 2^h | h:{h(i) | i:A} }
  --                             = sum { 2^h | h:H(A) }
  --                             = g(H(A))  
  --
  -- Lemma 33: for all n:N, the map h(n): X*n->N is in fact a bijection h(n):X*n->|X*n|
  -- between X*n and its integer cardinal |X*n|.
  --
  -- Proof: h(0): X*0->N is defined by h(0)(0) = 0, hence it is a bijection between X*0
  -- and {0} = 1 = |X*0|. We assume that the property is true for n. We need to show it
  -- is also true n+1. Hence we need to show that h(n+1) is a bijection between X*(n+1)
  -- and |X*(n+1)|. However given x:X*(n+1) , by definition we have:
  -- 
  -- h(n+1)(x) = sum { 2^h(n)(z) | z:E*(x) }
  --
  -- However, from the induction hypothesis we know that h(n):X*n->|X*n| is a bijection.
  -- We can therefore apply Lemma 32, which gives us a bijection f:P(X*n)->2^|X*n| defined
  -- by f(A) = sum { 2^h(n)(i) | i:A }. Looking back at the defining equation for h(n+1)(x),
  -- we see that h(n+1)(x) = f(E*(x)) for all x:X*(n+1). It follows that h(n+1) = foE*.
  -- However, from Lemma 29, E* defines a bijection E*:X*(n+1)->P(X*n). It follows that
  -- h(n+1) is a bijection from X*(n+1) to 2^|X*n|. Since by Lemma 29, 2^|X*n| = |X*(n+1)|,
  -- we have proved that h(n+1): X*(n+1) -> |X*(n+1)| is a bijection as requested 
  --
  -- Lemma 34: The map h:X* -> N is bijective
  --
  -- Proof: let x y:X* such that h(x) = h(y). We need to show that x = y. Let n be the max
  -- of rnk(x) and rnk(y), then both x and y are elements of X*n and h(n)(x) = h(x) = h(y)
  -- = h(n)(y). Since we know from Lemma 33 that h(n) is injective, we obtain x = y which
  -- shows that h is itself injective. It remains to show that H is surjective. So let
  -- m:N, we need to prove the existence of x:X* such that h(x) = m. However, since |X*n|
  -- = c(n) -> +oo as n->+oo, there is n:N such that m < |X*n|. In particular, m is an 
  -- element of the set |X*n| = {0,1, ... , |X*n|-1 }. By Lemma 33, we know that h(n)
  -- is a bijection from X*n to |X*n|. Hence, there exists x:X*n such that h(n)(x) = m.
  -- In particular, we have x:X* and h(x) = m.
