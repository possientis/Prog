  -- subset is the key relation on free structure Set
  -- providing a definition of subset which is self-contained
  -- i.e. with no dependencies to either 'belong' or '=='
  -- definition: We call an 'inclusion relation' on the free
  -- algebra (X,0,{},U) an binary relation <= satisfying the
  -- property (i)-(v) below. Such binary relation exists and
  -- is unique. Informally, it exists because we can define
  -- it by the structural-recursion-looking definition below.
  -- It is unique because axioms (i)-(v) enforce a unique
  -- definition at each recursive step below: they is only one 
  -- possible way to define this reltion. This needs formal
  -- mathematical proof.
