  -- Lemma 0: an inclusion relation exists and is unique
  --
  -- Such binary relation exists and is unique. Informally, 
  -- it exists because we can define it by the structural
  -- recursion-looking definition below. It is unique because 
  -- axioms (i)-(v) enforce a unique definition at each recursive 
  -- step below: they is only one possible way to define this 
  -- relation. This needs formal mathematical proof. 
  --
  -- Remark:
  -- One of the challenges is to prove that <= is reflexive
  -- and transitive. This seems surprisingly difficult as 
  -- any attempt to use structural induction for a proof
  -- seems to fail. There is a need to show other properties
  -- as well such as xUy == yUx (== being defined as <= and >=)
  -- 0Ux = x and xU(yUz) = (xUy)Uz, etc.
  --
  -- Definition: we define x == y as (x <= y && y <= x)
  --
  -- We do not know anything about == at this stage. One 
  -- succesful application of structural induction is
  -- as follows. We start with a definition:
  --
  -- Definition: We define the map E: X -> P(X) by:
  -- E(0) = 0 (the empty set)
  -- E({x}) = {x} (the singleton)
  -- E(aUb) = E(a)UE(b)
  -- informally, E(x) represents the 'elements' of x 
  -- (which is a subset of X). This is not quite true
  -- of course since various elements of E(x) could
  -- be equivalent with respect to ==. The breakthrough:
  --
  -- Lemma 1: forall x,y:X we have x <= y if and only if:
  -- forall z:E(x) exists z':E(y), z == z'
  --
  -- informally, this says that x is a subset of y iff
  -- every element of x is equivalent to an element of y.
  -- For once, structural induction seems to work. Proof:
  --
  -- x = 0. 0 <= y is always true. forall z:E(0) ... is 
  -- vacuously true. So equivalence is true when x = 0.
  --
  -- x = {x'}. We need to show that {x'} <= y is equivalent
  -- to the fact that forall z:E({x'})={x'}, there is z':E(y)
  -- such that z == z'. So we need to focus on the sub-Lemma
  --
  -- sub-Lemma: {x} <= y <=> exits z:E(y) x == z.
  --
  -- we shall do this by induction on y: 
  -- if y = 0, both sides of equivalence are always false.
  -- if y = {y'}. we need to show the equivalence
  -- {x} <= {y'} <=> x == y' which follows from property (iii)
  -- of the definition of <=.
  -- we now assume that y=aUb where a and b satisfy the induction
  -- hypothesis. We need to show {x} <= aUb <=> exists z:E(a)UE(b)
  -- such that x == z. From the induction hypothesis, we see that
  -- {x} <= a is equivalent to exists z:E(a) x == z, and similarly
  -- for b. So we need to show the equivalence {x} <= aUb <=>
  -- {x} <= a || {x} <= b  which is true by virtue of property 
  -- (iv) of the definition of <=. This completes the proof
  -- of the sub-lemma and the case x = {x'} of the lemma.
  --
  -- x = aUb, where a and b satisfy the induction hypothesis.
  -- we need to show that aUb <= y is equivalent to 
  -- for all z:E(a)UE(b) there is z':E(y), z == z'.
  -- However, from the induction hypothesis we see that
  -- a <= y is equivalent to forall z:E(a) there is z':E(y), 
  -- z == z', and similarly for b. So we have to prove the 
  -- equivalence aUb <= y <=> a <= y && b <= y which is true 
  -- from (v) of the definition of <=. This completes the proof.
  --
  -- Definition: we define order: X -> N as follows:
  -- order(0) = 1
  -- order({x}) = 1 + order(x)
  -- order(xUy) = 1 + max(order(x), order(y))
  --
  -- Lemma 2: forall x:X and z:E(x), order(z) < order(x)
  --
  -- by induction on x. If x = 0, E(0) is empty and the property
  -- is vacuously true. if x = {x'} then z:E(x) is z=x' and we
  -- have order(x') < order(x) by definition of order.
  -- if x = aUb where a, b satisfy the induction hypothesis and
  -- if z:E(x), then z:E(a) or z:E(b). in the first case, from
  -- the induction hypothesis we obtain order(z) < order(a)
  -- and in the second case order(z) < order(b). The result follows
  -- from order(a), order(b) < order(x).
  --
  -- We are now able to handle reflexivity of <=.
  --
  -- Lemma 3: the relation <= on X is reflexive
  --
  -- We proceed to prove x <= x by induction on order(x).
  -- If order(x) = 1, then x can only be 0 and 0 <= 0 is true.
  -- We assume the property is true for order(x) <= N >=1
  -- We need to show it is true for order(x) <= N+1. We 
  -- may assume that order(x) = N+1. We need to show that
  -- x <= x. Using Lemma 1, it is sufficient to show that
  -- for all z:E(x) we have z == z (which is z <= z).
  -- However from Lemma 2 we see that any such z is such that
  -- order(z) < order(x). In particular, order(z) <= N and the
  -- property z <= z follows from the induction hypothesis.
  --
  -- Lemma 4: forall x y:X, x <= xUy
  --
  -- Applying Lemma 1, it is sufficient to show that for all
  -- z:E(x) there is z':E(x)UE(y), z == z'. Hence it is 
  -- sufficient to prove that z == z for all z:E(x), which
  -- we know is true by reflexivity of Lemma 3.
  --
  -- Lemma 5: forall x y:X, xUy == yUx
  --
  -- Also follows immediately from Lemma 1 and reflexivity
  --
  -- Lemma 6: forall x y z:X, (xUy)Uz == xU(yUz)
  --
  -- idem
  --
  -- Lemma 7: forall x:X, xU0 == x
  --
  -- idem
  --
  -- And now the big prize:
  --
  -- Lemma 8: the relation <= on X is transitive
  --
  -- We shall prove the implication (x <= y)/\(y <= z) -> (x <= z)
  -- by induction on the maximum order of x, y and z. If the order
  -- of x,y,z are all less than 1, then x = y = z = 0 and the
  -- property is true. So we assume that the property is true
  -- whenever the orders of x,y,z are all less than (or equal to) N.
  -- We need to show the property is true whenever the orders
  -- of x,y,z are all less than N+1 (or equal). So let's assume this is the 
  -- case and that x <= y together with y <= z. We need to show that
  -- x <= z. Using Lemma 1, given u:E(x) we need to show the 
  -- existence of w:E(z) such that u == w. However from x <= y
  -- there exists v:E(y) such that u == v, and from y <= z, 
  -- there exists w:E(z) such that v == w. However, from Lemma 2
  -- the orders of u,v,w are all less than (or equal to) N. From 
  -- the induction hypothesis, u == v and v == w we can conclude
  -- that u == w which completes the proof of the lemma.
  --
  -- Lemma 9: the relation == on X is a congruence.
  --
  -- First we show it is an equivalence relation. Being defined
  -- as x == y iff (x <= y)/\(y <= x), it is clearly symmetric.
  -- Furthermore, it is reflexive from Lemma 3 and transitive
  -- from Lemma 8. We now show that == is compatible with the
  -- operators of the free algebra (X, 0, {}, U). We have 0 == 0.
  -- We assume that x == y. We need to show that {x} == {y}. This
  -- follows immediately from (iii) of the definition of <= 
  -- which states that {x} <= {y} is equivalent to x == y.
  -- We know assume that x == x' and y == y'. We need to show 
  -- that xUy == x'Uy'. It is sufficient to prove that 
  -- xUy <= x'Uy' follows from x <= x' and y <= y'. Using (v)
  -- of the definition of <=, it is sufficient to prove that 
  -- x <= x'Uy' and y <= x'Uy', and since xUy commutes modulo 
  -- == (by Lemma 5), it is sufficient to establish the following
  --
  -- Lemma 10: for all x x' y:X, if x <= x' then xUy <= x'Uy 
  -- 
  -- Applying Lemma 1, given z in E(xUy) = E(x)UE(y), we need
  -- to show the existence of z' in E(x')UE(y) such that 
  -- z == z' If z is in E(y) we can take z'=z and we are done
  -- since == is reflexive. If z is in E(x), from x <= x' we 
  -- obtain the existence of z' in E(x') such that z == z'. So 
  -- we are also done in this case.
  --
  --
  -- Lemma 11: The relation <= on X is compatible with ==.
  --
  -- That is if x == x' and y == y' and x <= y, then we 
  -- must have x' <= y'. This follows immediately from
  -- the transitivity of <= (Lemma 8)
  --
  --
  -- Definition: We can now define the quotient space X/==
  -- which will shall denote X* or (X*,0, {}, U), on which
  -- the inclusion <= is well defined (Lemma 11).
  --
  -- Lemma 12: for all x y:X* we have x=y iff (x<=y)/\(y<=x)
  --
  -- This seems pretty obvious, let us make sure we get it
  -- formally right. For the purpose of the proof, given 
  -- x y in X, we denote [x] and [y] the elements of X* 
  -- representing the classes of x and y modulo == respectively.
  -- we need to show that [x]=[y] iff ([x]<=[y])/\([y]<=[x]).
  -- but [x]=[y] is equivalent to x == y and [x]<=[y] is (by
  -- definition) equivalent to x <= y. So we are done.
  --
  -- Lemma 13: The relation <= on X* is a partial order.
  --
  -- Since [x]<=[y] is defined as x<=y (definition which is
  -- legitimate by Lemma 11), we immediately see that <=
  -- is reflexive and transitive. It remains to show that
  -- it is also symmetric. But [x]<=[y] and [y]<=[x] imply
  -- that x == y and consequently [x]=[y].
  --
  -- Just like we did for X we can define for X* the notion
  -- of a 'set's elements':
  --
  -- Definition: We define the map E*: X* -> P(X*) by:
  -- E*([0])   = 0         (the empty set) 
  -- E*({[x]}) = {[x]}     (the singleton)
  -- E*([a]U[b])   = E*([a])UE*([b]) (the union)
  --
  -- Warning: beware that given x in X or X*, the notation {x}
  -- is ambiguous (overloaded), as it may refer to the set
  -- theoretic singleton {x} (set with unique element x) or to the 
  -- value obtainied by applying the unary operator {} on x.
  --
  -- There is a natural relationship between E* and E:
  --
  -- Lemma 14: forall x:X, E*([x]) = { [y] | y:E[x] } 
  -- 
  -- Proof by structural induction.
  --
  -- In other words the elements of the class of x, are
  -- the classes of the elements of x.
  --
  -- Definition: given x y:X we say that x belongs to y,
  -- denoted x in y or x:y, if and only {x} <= y.
  --
  -- Lemma 15: the 'belong' (':' , 'in') relation on X
  -- is compatible with the congruence == on X, in other
  -- words, if x == x' and y == y' and x:y, then x':y'
  --
  -- Proof: we need to show that {x'} <= y', but == being
  -- a congruence we have {x'} == {x} and the result follows
  -- immediately by transitivity.
  --
  -- We can therefore extend the relation belong to the 
  -- quotient algebra X* by defining [x]:[y] iff x:y.
  --
  -- We now have the interesting lemma:
  --
  -- Lemma 16: for all x y:X*, x:y <=> x:E*(y)
  --
  -- Be careful that the above 'x:y' refers to the quotient
  -- binary relation ':' on X*, while 'x:E*(y)' refers to the
  -- usual set theoretic 'x is an element of the set E*(y)'.
  -- The set E*(y) is supposed to represents of the elements
  -- of X* which are 'element' of y. So Lemma 16 should be
  -- true, or something is wrong with the whole thing, or
  -- with the definition of ':' or with that of E*.
  --
  -- Proof: in order to be totally formal, we shall keep
  -- the notations [x] and [y] to distinguish elements of X
  -- from their corresponding classes in X*.
  --
  -- We need to show that [x]:[y] <=> [x]:E*([y]). However,
  -- [x]:[y] is defined as x:y which is itself defined 
  -- as {x} <= y. By Lemma 1, this is equivalent to the fact
  -- for all z in E({x}) = {x}, there should be z' in E(y)
  -- such that z == z'. In brief, [x]:[y] is equivalent 
  -- to the existence of z in E(y) such that x == z.
  -- Now from lemma 14, [x]:E*([y]) is equivalent to 
  -- [x] = [z] for some z in E(y). Hence it is also equivalent
  -- to the existence of z in E(y) such that x == z. We done.
  --
  -- Lemma 17: forall x y:X*, x <= y <=> E*(x) <= E*(y)
  -- 
  -- (E*(x) <= E*(y) refers to the usual set theoretic inclusion)
  -- Formally given x y:X we need to show that [x] <= [y] (which
  -- is equivalent to x <= y) is equivalent to E*([x]) <= E*([y]).
  -- First we prove =>. So we assume that x <= y, and we assume
  -- that [z] in E*([x]). We need to show that [z] in E*([y]).
  -- From Lemma 14, there is z1 in E(x) such that z == z1. 
  -- However from Lemma 1 and x <= y, there is z2 in E(y)
  -- such that z1 == z2. Hence by transitivity, there is z2 
  -- in E(y) such that z == z2. This shows from Lemma 14 that
  -- [z] in E*([y]) as requested. We now prove <=. So we assume
  -- that the inclusion E*([x]) <= E*([y]) holds and we need to
  -- show that x <= y. We shall use Lemma 1 so we assume that
  -- z in E(x). We need to show the existence of z' in E(y) 
  -- such that z == z' However from z in E(x) and Lemma 14 we obtain
  -- [z] in E*([x]) and from the assumed inclusion it follows that
  -- [z] in E*([y]). Using Lemma 14 once again, we see that 
  -- z == z' for some z' in E(y), we completes the proof.
  --
  --
  --Lemma 18: forall x y:X*, we have the equivalence:
  --  x <= y  <=> forall z:X*, z:x -> z:y
  --
  -- In other words, on the quotient algebra X*, the binary 
  -- relation <= truly behaves as in inclusion relation with
  -- respect to the belong relation ':', which is what we want.
  --
  -- Proof: 
  -- By virtue of Lemma 17, x <= y is equivalent to the
  -- inclusion E*(x) <= E*(y). However, from Lemma 16,
  -- given z:X*, z:x is equivalent to z:E*(x). Hence 
  -- we have to prove that the inclusion is equivalent to
  --  forall z:X*, z:E*(x) -> z:E*(y)
  -- which is indeed the case. 
  --
  -- Definition: we define the map F with domain X* by
  -- the following structural recursion:
  --
  --  (i)   F(0) = 0              (the empty set)
  --  (ii)  F({x}) = {F(x)}       (the set with one element)
  --  (iii) F(xUy) = F(x)UF(y)    (the usual set theoretic union)
  --
  --  Remark: we dropped the formal notation [x] in the previous
  --  definition, so 0 here denotes the element [0] of X* etc
  --
  --  Remark: The formal justification of the existence of the
  --  map F from the axioms of ZF is required. This is a slightly
  --  more difficult case than usual as we do not have an obvious
  --  set to work with as the range of F.
  --
  --  Remark: do not confuse F(x) with E*(x) eventhough the 
  --  definitions of F and E* are very similar. Given x:X*,
  --  E*(x) is a subset of X*. It is a set of formal expression.
  --  F(x) is not a subset of X*. It is simply a set which is
  --  the value of the expression x (to be exact of the class 
  --  expressions x) in the world of sets. For example, if 
  --  we consider the element 1 = {0} of X*. It is an equivalence
  --  class of formal expression, and F(1) = 1 (the set theoretic
  --  singleton {0}). We have E*(1) = {0}, the singleton containing
  --  the element 0 of X*, the latter the equivalence class of all
  --  formal expressions which are == to 0.
  --  
  --  Remark: With a bit of work, using the ZF axiom schema of
  --  replacement, we should be about to justify the fact that
  --  the range F(X*) is a well defined set. Hence we have a
  --  map F: X* -> F(X*) which is clearly surjective.
  --
  --  Lemma 19: the map F: X* -> F(X*) is a bijection
  --
  --  So this is like saying that we have defined a universe of
  --  sets F(X*), for which we have an exact representation as
  --  and algebraic data type (except maybe that algebraic data
  --  type corresponds to the notion of free universal algebra,
  --  and our algebra X* is not free, as it is a quotient algebra). 
  --
  --  Proof: we need to show the implication for all x y:X*,
  --    F(x) = F(y) -> x = y
  --
  -- contrary to natural belief, it seems that the inclusion
  -- relation is more primitive that the 'belong' relation.
