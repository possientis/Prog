problem linked to 3.4 ?
a : set, a_0 : a, h : N x a -> a
solve:
f(0) = a_0
f(S n) = h (n, f n)

ex: 3.8
Fokkinga's mutual recursion theorem
Let F:C -> C, with initial algebra mu:F m -> m
let a,b : C , assume product a x b exists
let h : F (a x b) -> a , k : F (a x b) -> b
let f : m -> a , g : m -> b

Then we have the equivalence:
<f,g> = |[ <h,k> ]| <-> f . mu = h . F <f,g> /\ g . mu = k . F <f,g>
