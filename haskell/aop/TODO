f: Nat -> a
f (0) = a0
f (S n) = h (n)
has a solution, why ?

ex: 3.8
Fokkinga's mutual recursion theorem
Let F:C -> C, with initial algebra mu:F m -> m
let a,b : C , assume product a x b exists
let h : F (a x b) -> a , k : F (a x b) -> b
let f : m -> a , g : m -> b

Then we have the equivalence:
<f,g> = |[ <h,k> ]| <-> f . mu = h . F <f,g> /\ g . mu = k . F <f,g>
