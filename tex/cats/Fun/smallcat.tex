We are now familiar with the notion of {\em category} as defined
in~(\ref{Cat:def:category}) as well as that of functor as defined
in~(\ref{Fun:def:functor}). Thanks to definition~(\ref{Fun:def:composition}),
we know how to {\em compose functors}, and we also have a notion of
{\em identity functor} as defined in~(\ref{Fun:def:identity}). So it is
very tempting at this stage to wonder whether the {\em collection of all
categories} could be turned into a category itself, in which the objects
are categories and the arrows are functors. However, we know from set theory 
that assuming the existence of the {\em set of all sets} leads to a 
contradiction. Those familiar with proof assistants such that Coq, Agda
and Lean will also be used to the idea that {\em the type of all types}
does not exist, as we have {\em universes} and {\em type levels} instead.
So we shall not attempt to define {\em the category of all catgeories} here.
Instead, we shall focus on a collection which is a lot smaller by considering
only those categories which are {\em small}, as per 
definition~(\ref{Cat:def:category:small}).

\begin{defin}\label{Fun:def:category:small:cat}
    We call \cat\ the category $\cat=(\ob, \arr, \dom, \cod, \id, \circ)$ where
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        (1)&\ &\ob = \{\ \Cat\ |\ \mbox{\Cat\ is a small category}\ \}\\
        (2)&\ &\arr =\{\ (\Cat,\Dat,F)\ |\ \Cat,\Dat\in\ob\ 
        \mbox{and}\ F:\Cat\to\Dat\ \}\\
        (3)&\ &\dom\,(\Cat,\Dat,F)=\Cat\\
        (4)&\ &\cod\,(\Cat,\Dat,F)=\Dat\\
        (5)&\ &\id(\Cat)=(\Cat,\Cat,I_{\cal C})\\
        (6)&\ &(\Dat,\Eat,G) \circ (\Cat,\Dat,F) = (\Cat,\Eat,G\circ F)
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where $(3)-(6)$ hold for all small categories $\Cat,\Dat,\Eat$, and
    functors $F:\Cat\to\Dat$ and $G:\Dat\to\Eat$, $I_{\cal C}$ is the identity
    functor of definition~(\ref{Fun:def:identity}) and $G\circ F$ is the 
    composition of $G$ and $F$ as per definition~(\ref{Fun:def:composition}).
\end{defin}

\noindent
{\bf Remark}: Similarly to definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) where the arrows
of the category \Set\ are not functions but {\em typed functions}, the arrrows
of the category \cat\ are not functors but {\em typed functors} as per 
defintion~(\ref{Fun:def:typed:untyped:functor}).
