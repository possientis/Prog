We are now familiar with the notion of {\em category} as defined
in~(\ref{Cat:def:category}) as well as that of functor as defined
in~(\ref{Fun:def:functor}). Thanks to definition~(\ref{Fun:def:composition}),
we know how to {\em compose functors}, and we also have a notion of
{\em identity functor} as defined in~(\ref{Fun:def:identity}). So it is
very tempting at this stage to wonder whether the {\em collections of all
categories} could be turned into a category itself, in which the arrows
would be the functors.
