\begin{defin}\label{Fun:def:bifunctor}
    We call {\em bifunctor} any functor $F:\Cone\times\Ctwo\to\Dat$ defined
    on the cartesian product $\Cone\times\Ctwo$ of two categories \Cone\ and
    \Ctwo, where \Dat\ is also a category.
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}\label{Fun:def:partial:functor:1}
    Let $F:\Cone\times\Ctwo\to\Dat$ be a bifunctor and let $a_{1}\in\Cone$. 
    We call {\em first partial functor at} $a_{1}$, the functor $G:\Ctwo\to\Dat$ 
    defined by $G=(G_{0},G_{1})$ with:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
            (1)&\ &G_{0}(a_{2}) = F(a_{1},a_{2})\\
            (2)&\ &G_{1}(f_{2}) = F(\id(a_{1}),f_{2})
        \end{eqnarray*}
    where $(1)-(2)$ hold for all $a_{2}\in\ob\ \Ctwo$ and $f_{2}\in\arr\ \Ctwo$.
\end{defin}

\noindent
{\bf Remark}: As per notation~(\ref{Fun:notation:functor:F0:F1}),
we are using the same notation $F$ in definition~(\ref{Fun:def:partial:functor:1}) 
to describe the actions of the functor on both objects and arrows.


\noindent
{\bf Remark}: Given $a_{2}\in\ob\ \Ctwo$, from 
definition~(\ref{Cat:def:canonical:product}) the ordered pair $(a_{1},a_{2})$
is a well-defined object of the product category $\Cone\times\Ctwo$ and 
$F(a_{1},a_{2})$ is therefore a well-defined object of the category \Dat.

\noindent
{\bf Remark}: Given $f_{2}\in\arr\ \Ctwo$, from
definition~(\ref{Cat:def:canonical:product}) and the fact that $\id(a_{1})$
is an arrow in \Cone, the ordered pair $(\id(a_{1}),f_{2})$ is a 
well-defined arrow of $\Cone\times\Ctwo$ and
$F(\id(a_{1}),f_{2})$ is therefore a well-defined arrow of the category \Dat.

\begin{notation}\label{Fun:notation:partial:functor:1}
    The first partial functor of $F$ at $a_{1}$ is denoted $F(a_{1},-)$.
\end{notation}

\begin{prop}\label{Fun:prop:partial:functor:1}
    Let $F:\Cone\times\Ctwo\to\Dat$ be a bifunctor and let $a_{1}\in\Cone$. 
    Then the first partial functor at $a_{1}$ of $F$ is indeed a functor
    $F(a_{1},-):\Ctwo\to\Dat$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G=(G_{0},G_{1})$ denote the first partial functor at $a_{1}$. 
    We need to check that properties~$(1)-(5)$ of 
    definition~(\ref{Fun:def:functor}) are satisfied, which goes as follows:

    $(1)$: $G_{0}$ is indeed a map $G_{0}:\ob\ \Ctwo\to\ob\ \Dat$: it is 
    defined on the collection $\ob\ \Ctwo$ and for all $a_{2}\in\ob\ \Ctwo$,
    $G_{0}(a_{2})=F(a_{1},a_{2})$ is an element of $\ob\ \Dat$.

    $(2)$: $G_{1}$ is indeed a map $G_{1}:\arr\ \Ctwo\to\arr\ \Dat$: it is 
    defined on the collection $\arr\ \Ctwo$ and for all $f_{2}\in\arr\ \Ctwo$,
    $G_{1}(f_{2})=F(\id(a_{1}),f_{2})$ is an element of $\arr\ \Dat$.

    $(3)$: We need to show that $G_{1}(f_{2}):G_{0}(a_{2})\to G_{0}(b_{2})$ 
    whenever we have $f_{2}:a_{2}\to b_{2}\ @\ \Ctwo$. So we need to 
    show that $F(\id(a_{1}),f_{2}):F(a_{1},a_{2})\to F(a_{1},b_{2})$. However,
    this follows immediately from the functoriality of $F$ and the fact that
    $(\id(a_{1}),f_{2}):(a_{1},a_{2})\to (a_{1},b_{2})\ @\ \Cone\times\Ctwo$
    since $\id(a_{1}):a_{1}\to a_{1}\ @\ \Cone$ and $f_{2}:a_{2}\to b_{2}
    \ @\ \Ctwo$, and using definition~(\ref{Cat:def:canonical:product}).
    
    $(4)$: We need to show that $G_{1}(\id(a_{2}))=\id(\,G_{0}(a_{2})\,)$ for
    all $a_{2}\in\ob\ \Ctwo$. In other words, we need to show that
    $F(\id(a_{1}),\id(a_{2}))=\id(\,F(a_{1},a_{2})\,)$, which follows
    immediately from the functoriality of $F$ and
    $(\id(a_{1}),\id(a_{2}))=\id(a_{1},a_{2})$.

    $(5)$: We need to show that $G_{1}(g_{2}\circ f_{2})=G_{1}(g_{2})
    \circ G_{1}(f_{2})$ whenever we have $f_{2}:a_{2}\to b_{2}\ @\ \Ctwo$ and 
    $g:b_{2}\to c_{2}\ @\ \Ctwo$. This goes as follows:
        \begin{eqnarray*}G_{1}(g_{2}\circ f_{2})
            &=&F(\id(a_{1}),g_{2}\circ f_{2})\ \leftarrow\ 
            \mbox{$(2)$ of def.~(\ref{Fun:def:partial:functor:1})}\\
            TODO
        \end{eqnarray*}
 
\end{proof}
