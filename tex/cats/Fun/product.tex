\begin{defin}\label{Fun:def:canonical:product}
    We call {\em canonical product} of two functors $F_{1}:\Cone\to\Done$ and
    $F_{2}:\Ctwo\to\Dtwo$ the functor $G:\Cone\times\Ctwo\to\Done\times\Dtwo$
    defined by $G=(G_{0},G_{1})$ with:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
            (1)&\ &G_{0}(a_{1},a_{2}) = (\,F_{1}(a_{1})\,,\,F_{2}(a_{2})\,)\\
            (2)&\ &G_{1}(f_{1},f_{2}) = (\,F_{1}(f_{1})\,,\,F_{2}(f_{2})\,)
        \end{eqnarray*}
    where $\Cone,\Ctwo, \Done, \Dtwo$ are arbitrary categories, $(1)$ holds 
    for all $a_{1}\in\ob\ \Cone$ and $a_{2}\in\ob\ \Ctwo$, and $(2)$ holds 
    for all $f_{1}\in\arr\ \Cone$ and $f_{2}\in\arr\ \Ctwo$.
\end{defin}
\noindent
{\bf Remark}: In accordance with notation~(\ref{Fun:notation:functor:F0:F1}),
we are using the same notations $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ in 
definition~(\ref{Fun:def:canonical:product}) to describe the actions of these
functors both on objects and on arrows. The alternative would be to use the
notations $(F_{1})_{0}$, $(F_{1})_{1}$, $(F_{2})_{0}$ and $(F_{2})_{1}$ which 
would arguably be harder to read.

\begin{notation}\label{Fun:notation:canonical:product}
    The canonical product of functors $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ is denoted
    $F_{1}\times F_{2}$.
\end{notation}

\begin{prop}
    Let $F_{1}:\Cone\to\Done$ and $F_{2}:\Ctwo\to\Dtwo$ be two functors. Then 
    the product of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ is indeed a functor $F_{1}\times F_{2}: 
    \Cone\times\Ctwo\to\Done\times\Dtwo$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G=(G_{0},G_{1})$ denote the product functor $F_{1}\times F_{2}$.
    We need to check that properties~$(1)-(5)$ of 
    definition~(\ref{Fun:def:functor}) are satisfied, which goes as follows:

    $(1)$: $G_{0}$ is indeed a map $G_{0}:\ob\ (\Cone\times\Ctwo)\to\ob\ (\Done
    \times\Dtwo)$: firstly, $G_{0}$ is defined on the 
    collection of all $(a_{1},a_{2})$ where $a_{1}\in\ob\ \Cone$
    and $a_{2}\in\ob\ \Ctwo$. According to 
    definition~(\ref{Cat:def:canonical:product}), this is precisely 
    the collection $\ob\ (\Cone\times\Ctwo)$. Furthermore $G_{0}(a_{1},a_{2})$
    is defined as $(\,F_{1}(a_{1})\,,\,F_{2}(a_{2})\,)$ and since 
    $F_{1}:\Cone\to\Done$ while $F_{2}:\Ctwo\to\Dtwo$, we have $F_{1}(a_{1})
    \in\ob\ \Done$ together with $F_{2}(a_{2})\in\ob\ \Dtwo$. Hence we see that
    $G_{0}(a_{1},a_{2})$ is indeed a member of the collection 
    $\ob\ (\Done\times\Dtwo)$.
\end{proof}
