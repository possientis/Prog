Let $F:\Cat\to\Dat$ and $G:\Dat\to\Cat$ be functors where \Cat\ and \Dat\ 
are categories. Suppose $\eta$ is a unit of $(F,G)$. Then in particular,
$\eta$ is a natural transformation $\eta:I_{\cal C}\Rightarrow G\circ F$.
Now if we are precise and wish to spell out the relevant typed functors,
$\eta$ is a natural transformation between $(\Cat,\Cat,I_{\cal C})$ and
$(\Cat,\Cat,G\circ F)$.
