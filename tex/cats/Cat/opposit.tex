\begin{defin}\label{Cat:def:opposit}
    Let $\Cat=(\ob, \arr, \dom,\cod, \id, \circ)$ be a category.
    We call {\em opposit category of \Cat}, the category denoted
    \Cop\ and defined by:
        \[
            \Cop=(\ob, \arr, \cod, \dom, \id, \circ')
        \]
    where the composition operator $\circ'$ is defined by 
    $f \circ' g = g\circ f$, for all $f,g\in\arr$.
\end{defin}

So if $\Cat=(\ob, \arr, \dom,\cod, \id, \circ)$ is a category, the opposit
category \Cop\ is almost identical, except for the composition operator
$\circ'$ which is a flipped version of $\circ$, and for $\dom$ and $\cod$ 
which have been swapped with each other. The collection of objects of
\Cop\ is the same as that of \Cat, giving us the equality $\ob\ \Cop=\ob\ 
\Cat$. Likewise, the collection of arrows of \Cop\ is the same as that of 
\Cat, giving us this other equality $\arr\ \Cop=\arr\ \Cat$.
