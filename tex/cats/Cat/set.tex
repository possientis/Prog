\begin{defin}\label{Cat:def:set}
    We call \Set\ the category $\Set=(\ob, \arr, \dom, \cod, \id, \circ)$ where
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        (1)&\ &\ob = \{\ x\ |\  \mbox{x is a set}\ \}\\
        (2)&\ &\arr = \{\ (a,b,f)\ |\  \mbox{f is a function $f : a\to b$}\ \}\\
        (3)&\ &\dom\,(a,b,f) = a\\
        (4)&\ &\cod\,(a,b,f) = b\\
        (5)&\ &\id(a) = (a,a,i(a))\\
        (6)&\ &(b,c,g)\circ(a,b,f) = (a,c,g\circ f)
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where $(3)-(6)$ hold for all sets $a,b,c$ and functions $f:a\to b$,
    $g:b\to c$, $i(a):a\to a$ denotes the usual identity function on $a$,
    and $g\circ f$ denotes the usual function composition defined by 
    $(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))$, for all $x\in a$.
\end{defin}
The collection of objects of the category \Set\ is defined to be the 
class of all sets. We are using the set comprehension notation 
$\{\ x\ |\ \mbox{$x$ is a set}\ \}$ to denote this class, but this is an
abuse of notation as \ob\ is not a set but a proper class. One could 
think of a class as a precicate $P(x)$ of first order logic with one
free variable. From this point of view $\ob$ becomes the predicate
$\ob(x)=\top$, i.e. the predicate which returns true for all $x$.
Every set satisfies the predicate \ob, so every set is a member of 
the class \ob. The class \ob\ is not a set because the set-theoretic
statement $\exists y, \forall z, z\in y\ \Leftrightarrow\ \ob(z)$
can be proven false. In other words, there exists no set $y$ whose
elements $z$ are exactly the sets which satisfy the predicate \ob.
There exists no set which contains all sets.

The collection of arrows of the category \Set\ is defined to be the 
class of triples $(a,b,f)$ where $a,b$ are sets and $f$ is a function
$f:a\to b$. This last notation is a common set-theoretic shortcut to
express the fact that $f$ is a {\em function} with {\em domain} $a$ and 
{\em range} {\bf which is a subset of} $b$. A {\em function} is any set $f$
whose elements are ordered pairs $(x,y)$ and which is functional, i.e.
for which the following implication holds for all sets $x,y,y'$:
    \[
        (x,y)\in f\ \land\ (x,y')\in f\ \Rightarrow\ y = y'
    \]
The {\em domain} of a function $f$ is the set of all sets $x$ for which there
exists a set $y$ with $(x,y)\in f$. The {\em range} of a function $f$ is the 
set of all sets $y$ for which there exists a set $x$ with $(x,y)\in f$.
If $x$ belongs to the domain of a function $f$, the notation '$f(x)$' commonly
refers to the unique set $y$ with $(x,y)\in f$. 

Now, as already pointed
out the notation $f:a\to b$ only requires that the range of $f$ should be
a subset of $b$. There is no requirement that the range of $f$ should be
equal to $b$. So if $f:a\to b$ and $b\subseteq c$ then $f:a\to c$.
This explains why the collection of arrows \arr\ is defined as a class of 
triples $(a,b,f)$ rather than a class of functions $f$. Knowing the 
function $f$ does not tell you which {\em codomain} it should have. Any 
set $b$ which is a superset of its range is a possible codomain. So we 
keep the set $b$ together with the function $f$ in the triple $(a,b,f)$
so as to remember which codomain is intended for this particular arrow
of the category \Set. Incidentally, we also keep the range $a$ of the 
function $f$ in the triple $(a,b,f)$ but this is not necessary, as the
knowledge of $f$ does allow us to recover its domain $a$. However,
the triple $(a,b,f)$ is convenient, allowing us to treat {\em domain} 
and {\em codomain} uniformly. Once again, it should be remembered that
the collection of arrows \arr\ is not a set but a proper class, 
corresponding to the predicate $\arr(x)$ defined as follows:
    \[
        \arr(x)=\exists a\,\exists b\,\exists f\,,\  
        x = (a,b,f)\ \land\ f : a \to b
    \]
The maps $\dom:\arr\to\ob$ and $\cod:\arr\to\ob$ for the category \Set\
are defined respectively by $\dom(a,b,f)=a$ and $\cod(a,b,f)=b$. This 
looks simple enough, but for those who worry about foundational issues,
we should just note that these are also proper classes which can be
encoded as predicates. For example:
    \[
    \dom(x)=\exists u\,\exists v\,,\ x = (u,v)\ \land\ \arr(u)\ \land 
    \ (\ \exists a\,\exists b\,\exists f\,,\  u = (a,b,f)\ \land\ 
    v = a\ ) 
    \]
In other words, any set $x$ satisfies the predicate $\dom(x)$ \ifand\ 
it is an ordered pair $(u,v)$ where $u$ satisfies the predicate $\arr(u)$
and for which there exist sets $a,b,f$ with $u=(a,b,f)$ and $v=a$.
In short, $(u,v)$ satisfies the predicate $\dom$ \ifand\ $u$ is an
arrow $u=(a,b,f)$ and $v=a$.

We defined the identity operator $\id$ by $\id(a)=(a,a,i(a))$ and the 
composition operator $\circ$ by $(b,c,g)\circ(a,b,f)= (a,c,g\circ f)$ 
where $g\circ f$ is the usual function composition and $i(a):a\to a$ is
the usual identity function. As before, these defined maps are not 
functional sets of ordered pairs but rather proper classes which we 
could also encode as precicates of first order logic. One important
point to note is the fact that $(6)$ of definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set})
only defines the composition arrow $(b,c,g)\circ(a,b,f)$ where
$f:a\to b$ and $g:b\to c$. In other words, the composition 
$(d,c,g)\circ(a,b,f)$ with $f:a\to b$ and $g:d\to c$ is only 
defined when $b=d$. Furthermore, the usual function composition
$g\circ f$ is a function $g\circ f:a \to c$ which from~$(2)$ of
definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) means that the composed arrow
$(b,c,g)\circ(a,b,f)=(a,c,g\circ f)$ is indeed a member of the
collection \arr, and the partial map $\circ$ thus defined is 
indeed a partial map $\circ:\arr\times\arr\to\arr$.


\begin{prop}\label{Cat:prop:set:is:category}
    The category \Set\ of definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) is a category.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Now that we have defined 
    the data $(\ob, \arr, \dom, \cod, \id, \circ)$ of the category \Set, 
    it is time to check this data actually forms a category. We need to
    check that conditions $(7)-(13)$ of definition~(\ref{Cat:def:category})
    are satisfied. 
    
    $(7)$: suppose $f^{*}$ and $g^{*}$ are two members of 
    the collection \arr. We need to check that $g^{*}\circ f^{*}$ is defined 
    \ifand\ $\cod(f^{*})=\dom(g^{*})$. Using~$(2)$ of 
    definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}), $f^{*}$ can be written $f^{*}=(a,b,f)$
    for some function $f:a\to b$ and $g^{*}$ can be written $g^{*}=(d,c,g)$
    for some function $g:d\to c$. However, from $(6)$ of 
    definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}), the arrrow $(d,c,g)\circ(a,b,f)$ is only 
    defined in the case when $b=d$. Furthermore, from~$(4)$ of 
    definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) we have $\cod(f^{*})=b$ and from~$(3)$ 
    of definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) we have $\dom(g^{*})=d$. We conclude
    that $g^{*}\circ f^{*}$ is defined \ifand\ $\cod(f^{*})=\dom(g^{*})$
    as required.

    $(8)$: Let $f^{*},g^{*}\in\arr$ such that $\cod(f^{*})=\dom(g^{*})$. 
    We need to show that $\dom(g^{*}\circ f^{*})=\dom(f^{*})$. As before,
    $f^{*}$ and $g^{*}$ can be written as $f^{*}=(a,b,f)$ and
    $g^{*}=(b,c,g)$ where $f:a\to b$ and $g:b \to c$. We have
    $g^{*}\circ f^{*}=(a,c,g\circ f)$. Using~$(3)$ of 
    definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) we obtain $\dom(g^{*}\circ f^{*})=a=
    \dom(f^{*})$.

    $(9)$: Let $f^{*},g^{*}\in\arr$ such that $\cod(f^{*})=\dom(g^{*})$. 
    We need to show that $\cod(g^{*}\circ f^{*})=\cod(g^{*})$. As before,
    we have $g^{*}\circ f^{*}=(a,c,g\circ f)$ and $g^{*}=(b,c,g)$. Using~$(4)$ 
    of definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}) we obtain $\cod(g^{*}\circ f^{*})=c=
    \cod(g^{*})$.

    $(10)$: Let $f^{*},g^{*},h^{*}\in\arr$ with $\cod(f^{*})=\dom(g^{*})$ 
    and $\cod(g^{*})=\dom(h^{*})$. We need to show the equality:
    $(h^{*}\circ g^{*})\circ f^{*} = h^{*}\circ(g^{*}\circ f^{*})$.
    However, $f^{*},g^{*},h^{*}$ can be decomposed as 
    $f^{*}=(a,b,f)$, $g^{*}=(b,c,g)$ and $h^{*}=(c,d,h)$ with
    $f:a\to b$, $g:b \to c$, and $h:c\to d$. We have:
        \begin{eqnarray*}(h^{*}\circ g^{*})\circ f^{*}
            &=&((c,d,h)\circ(b,c,g))\circ (a,b,f)\\
            \mbox{$(6)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(b,d,h\circ g)\circ (a,b,f)\\
            \mbox{$(6)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(a,d,(h\circ g)\circ f)\\
            \mbox{assoc of usual composition\ $\rightarrow$\ }
            &=&(a,d,h\circ (g\circ f))\\
            \mbox{$(6)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(c,d,h)\circ (a,c,g\circ f)\\
            \mbox{$(6)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(c,d,h)\circ ((b,c,g)\circ(a,b,f))\\
            &=&h^{*}\circ(g^{*}\circ f^{*})
        \end{eqnarray*}
    
    $(11)$: Let $a$ be a set. We need to show that $\dom(\id(a))=a=\cod(\id(a))$.  
    This follows immediately from $\id(a)=(a,a,i(a))$ which is $(5)$ of
    definition~(\ref{Cat:def:set}).

    $(12)$: Let $f^{*}=(a,b,f)$ be an arrow with $\dom(f^{*})=a$. We need to 
    show that $f^{*}\circ\id(a)=f^{*}$, which follows from:
        \begin{eqnarray*}f^{*}\circ\id(a)
            &=&(a,b,f)\circ\id(a)\\
            \mbox{$(5)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(a,b,f)\circ(a,a,i(a))\\
            \mbox{$(6)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(a,b,f\circ i(a))\\
            \mbox{usual right-identity\ $\rightarrow$\ }
            &=&(a,b,f)\\
            &=&f^{*}
        \end{eqnarray*}
    $(13)$: Let $f^{*}=(b,a,f)$ be an arrow with $\cod(f^{*})=a$. We need to 
    show that $\id(a)\circ f^{*}=f^{*}$, which follows from:
        \begin{eqnarray*}\id(a)\circ f^{*}
            &=&\id(a)\circ(b,a,f)\\
            \mbox{$(5)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(a,a,i(a))\circ(b,a,f)\\
            \mbox{$(6)$ of Def~(\ref{Cat:def:set})\ $\rightarrow$\ } 
            &=&(b,a,i(a)\circ f)\\
            \mbox{usual left-identity\ $\rightarrow$\ }
            &=&(b,a,f)\\
            &=&f^{*}
        \end{eqnarray*}
This completes our proof of properties~$(7)-(13)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}\label{Cat:notation:set:arrow}
    We shall denote an arrow $(a,b,f)$ of the category \Set\ simply by~$f$. 
\end{notation}
\noindent
{\bf Remark} So on top of its usual set-theoretic meaning, the notation 
$f:a\to b$ may also have its categorical meaning expressing the fact 
that $f$ is an arrow of the category \Set\ with domain $a$ and codomain 
$b$, i.e. that $f$ is really $(a,b,f)$. 

\begin{notation}\label{Cat:notation:set:arrow:apply}
    If $f^{*}:a \to b$ is an arrow of the category \Set, for all $x\in a$ 
    we shall write $f^{*}(x)$ as a shortcut for $f(x)$ where $f^{*}=(a,b,f)$.
