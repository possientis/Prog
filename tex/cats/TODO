cat is locally small
cocartesian functor: SetxSet -> Set , F(a1,a2) = a1 + a2
locally small => small
category of locally small catgeories
natural transformation paradox: alpha also G => F 
functor category
composing a nat with a functor F . alpha
composing a nat with a functor alpha . F
define Par (category of sets and partial functions)
define Rel (category os sets and relations)
define the notion of sub-category: Set <= Par <= Rel ?
define an isomorphism
define the List : Set -> Set
define the power set functor : Set -> Set 
define a initial/terminal object
define a coproduct/product of two objects
define the category cone_C(a,b) 
product of (a,b) <-> terminal in Cone_C(a,b)
! : I => K_1 for any terminal 1 in C

C: with (x) : CxC -> C, (x) should be a functor F such that
C(c,a)xC(c,b) naturally isomorphic to C(c,F(a,b))
similar idea for (+)
polynomial functors on Set, more generally on C
natural isos:
ax1 ->1
axb -> bxa
(axb)xc -> ax(bxc)
