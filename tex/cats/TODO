F1:C->D1, F2:C -> D2, define <F1,F2>:C -> D1xD2
cocartesian functor: SetxSet -> Set , F(a1,a2) = a1 + a2
locally small => small
category of locally small catgeories
natural transformation paradox: alpha also G => F 
functor category
category of F-algebra for F:C-> C : Alg(F)
category of F-coalgebra for F:C->C: coAlg(F)

if F is a polynomial endofunctor in Set, then Alg(F) has an initial object

pointwise product and sum of functors in Set.

polynomial functors on Set:
    1. id : Set -> Set is polynomial
    2. F,G: Set -> Set polynomial => G . F polynomial
    3. F,G: Set -> Set polynomial => F + G and FG polynomial where:
        (F + G) (a) = F a + G a (pointwise sum)
        (F + G) (f) = F f + F g
        (FG)(a) = F(a)xG(a)
        (FG)(f) = F(f)xG(f)

composing a nat with a functor F . alpha
composing a nat with a functor alpha . F
define Par (category of sets and partial functions)
define Rel (category os sets and relations)
define the notion of sub-category: Set <= Par <= Rel ?
define an isomorphism
define the List : Set -> Set
define the power set functor : Set -> Set 
define a initial/terminal object
define a coproduct/product of two objects
define the category cone_C(a,b) 
product of (a,b) <-> terminal in Cone_C(a,b)
! : I => K_1 for any terminal 1 in C

C: with (x) : CxC -> C, (x) should be a functor F such that
C(c,a)xC(c,b) naturally isomorphic to C(c,F(a,b))
