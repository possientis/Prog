// Interpreter Design Pattern
// from the Gang of Four book:
// "If a particular kind of problem occurs often enough, then it might be
// worthwhile to express instances of the problem as sentences in a simple
// language. Then you can build an interpreter that solves the problem by 
// interpreting these sentences. For example, searching for strings that 
// match a pattern is a common problem. Regular expressions are a standard 
// language for specifying patterns of strings. Rather than building custom 
// algorithms to match each pattern against strings, search algorithms could 
// interpret a regular expression that specifies a set of strings to match.
