understand why '(display x)' does not get executed in test.scm
understand why (lambda () (define x 0) (display x)) would fail unlike 
               (lambda () (let ((x 0)) (display x)))


find bug in test.scm
resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created) 
define primitives from language itself
implement macros !!!!!
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
