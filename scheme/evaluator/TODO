review semantics of lazy-eval (not.scm)
why is lazy-run not doing anything?
can we unify test-expression tools with some force-thunk?

(define (try a b) (if (= 0 a) 1 b))
compare lazy and strict eval of
> (try 0 (error))


define primitives from language itself
implement macros
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
