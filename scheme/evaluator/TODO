continue to attempt replicating failure of ./lazy-run unit-test.scm
for named-let in test.scm

resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created) 
define primitives from language itself
implement macros
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
