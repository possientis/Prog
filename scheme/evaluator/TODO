understand why thunk of test.scm cannot be forced without error
remove errors in unit-test
review file eval-procedure and accept change at bottom
carefully re-think semantics of lazy-eval (do we need dorun primitive?)
why is lazy-run not doing anything?

(define (try a b) (if (= 0 a) 1 b))
compare lazy and strict eval of
> (try 0 (error))


define primitives from language itself
implement macros
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
