in test.scm write different version of 'code' with explicit 'quote' and 'list'

see debug in tools.scm while running test.scm. It seems that when evaluation
of left is carried out, it no longer has the appropriate environment to find 'loop'

test.scm: error occurs when (quote ... ) around (let loop ...)
further isolate bug in test.scm

resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created) 
define primitives from language itself
implement macros
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
