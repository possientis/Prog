understand while lazy-run of unit-test fails while test-lazy.scm rightly returns #f
decide whether to keep lazy-eval-dorun simly as strict-eval
resolve bug test-lazy.scm (see impact of 'display line in 'try) 
lazy-run unit-test failing on lazy test
should it be dorun or force-thunk in application.scm ?
unit-test do run
test.scm : force-thunk not defined: what do we do?
lazy-run frame-test.scm fails when adding frame3 (which is odd because it seems
to be exactly what test.scm (which works) was meant to address).
lazy-run frame-test.scm fails (when frame = frame3)
restore frame3 in frame-test
fix depend.sh
resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created)
define primitives from language itself
implement macros !!!!!
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
