understand why the 'solution' of forcing code in file-to-code.scm leads to 
unit test failures.

need a way to force (read file) in test.scm, before closing port
reduce bug in test.scm
(strict-eval '(load "main.scm")) fails under lazy-eval (cf unit-test)
scm unit-test fails with (test-all-files)
decide with lazy-load should force thunk or not
resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created) 
define primitives from language itself
implement macros !!!!!
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
