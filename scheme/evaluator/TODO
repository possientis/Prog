see lazy.scm: crucial line in function 'try' changes behaviour: even when crucial line is added so that the evaluation of unset-lazy is triggered (why is that?), this evaluation seems to occur at the wrong time (see debug output). It looks like when binding argument values to variables, we need to force things sooner.
see test.scm: (lazy?) returning #t under strict-evaluation within lazy interpreter

make lazy evaluation test work under lazy evaluation

resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created)
define primitives from language itself
implement macros !!!!!
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
