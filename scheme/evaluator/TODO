lazy-run frame-test.scm fails (when frame = frame3)
restore frame3 in frame-test
fix depend.sh
resolve bug in frame3 (scm frame3-bug.scm (under frame3): wrong environment created)
define primitives from language itself
implement macros !!!!!
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
