The following are functionally identical scripts:

run.py    -> written in python
run.sh    -> written in shell script (sh)
run.scm   -> written in scheme (scm)
run.c     -> written in C
Run.java  -> written in Java

run as follows:

./run.py filename
./run.sh filename
./run.scm filename
./run filename (for C), gcc -o run run.c to recompile
java Run filename (for Java), javac Run.java to recompile
