understand dependency DAG
revise run to as to evaluate or compile + run
Understand the suble differences between:
  - apply-in-underlying-scheme
  - apply-primitive
  - apply-primitive-procedure
Understand why apply-primitive cannot simply be defined as 'apply'

follow up on debug.scm

repl.scm is broken
check semantics of '() vs ()
continue unit testing of analyze

introduce parallel between apply and eval, in relation to eval-in-underlying-scheme
deal with issue of whether eval takes 1 or 2 arguments

Understand rational for inluding components within components

change semantics of apply

understand the following:
exp = '(define f (lambda () 12))
((analyze exp) global-env) ; creating binding through analyze
(eval (f) global-env) ; this will fail


incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
