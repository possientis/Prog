play with lazy-repl
need to deal with environments allowing thunks as values
somehow feel we need to be able to test whether an object is a thunk



define primitives from language itself
implement macros
lazy evaluation of arguments (with or without memoization)
change semantics of apply
check semantics of '() vs ()
incorporate frame4 with hash-table library
