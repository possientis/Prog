continue rewriting code so as to keep parallel between 'eval' and 'analyze'

Understand the suble differences between:
  - apply
  - apply-in-underlying-scheme
  - apply-primitive

follow up on debug.scm

continue unit testing of analyze

change semantics of apply

understand the following:
exp = '(define f (lambda () 12))
((analyze exp) global-env) ; creating binding through analyze
(eval (f) global-env) ; this will fail
