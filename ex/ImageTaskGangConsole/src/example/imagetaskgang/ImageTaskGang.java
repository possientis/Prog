/**
 * @class ImageTaskGang
 *
 * @brief Customizes the TaskGang framework to use the Java
 *        ExecutorCompletionService to concurrently download a List of
 *        images from web servers, apply image processing filters to
 *        each image, and store the results in files that can be
 *        displayed to users via various means defined by the context
 *        in which this class is used.
 *
 *        This class implements the roles of the "Proactive Initiator"
 *        and "Completion Handler" in the Proactor pattern and also
 *        plays the role of the "Concrete Class" in the Template
 *        Method pattern.
