#       0-based indexing.

echo ${stringZ:0}     # abcABC123ABCabc
echo ${stringZ:1}     # bcABC123ABCabc
echo ${stringZ:7}     # 23ABCabc
echo ${stringZ:7:3}   # 23A

# Is it possible to index from the right end of the string?
echo ${stringZ:-4}    # abcABC123ABCabc
# Defaults to full string, as in ${parameter:-default}.
# However . . .
echo ${stringZ:(-4)}  # Cabc
echo ${stringZ: -4}   # Cabc
# Now, it works.
# Parentheses or added space "escape" the position parameter.
