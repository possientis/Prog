# Admittedly, this is a kludgy implementation of timed input.
# However, the "-t" option to "read" simplifies this task.
# See the "t-out.sh" script.
# However, what about timing not just single user input,
#+ but an entire script?
# If you need something really elegant ...
#+ consider writing the application in C or C++,
#+ using appropriate library functions, such as 'alarm' and 'setitimer.'
