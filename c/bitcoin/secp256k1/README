The shared library libsecp256k1.so is already installed on the system.
When linking an object file with the -lsecp256k1 option:

$ gcc test.o -lsecp256k1

the system version of the library (in /usr/local/lib) will be used,
not the local version (in working directory). In order to link 
against the local version of the library, add the -L. option:

$ gcc test.o -lsecp256k1 -L.

When running the executable a.out, the loader will load the system
version of the shared library, not the local version. To ensure
the local version is loaded, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./a.out
