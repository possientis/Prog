<h3>Java Threads and Synchronizers (Assignment 2)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

This assignment extends upon your solution to <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">assignment
1</a>.  All students will use Java built-in monitor objects to
implement a subset of the Java java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class,
which we call SimpleSemaphore.  Students taking the class for grad
credit will also use a Java 8 StampedLock to implement a subset of the
java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong class, which we call
SimpleAtomicLong. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src and test directories you'll find a number of files, all of
which you should read.  However, the only two files you need to modify
are SimpleAtomicLong.java and SimpleSemaphore.java in the
src/edu/vandy/utils directory, which contains the skeleton Java code
that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here"
comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL
STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here"
portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Implement the SimpleSemaphore class using Java built-in monitor
  objects, which are covered in <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3rcTTF45cA&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=23">this</A>
  video.  Your SimpleSemaphore implementation must support both "fair"
  and "non-fair" semantics, which are covered in <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoaZTkot6-g&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=18">this</A>
  video. Naturally, your SimpleSemaphore solution can't use Java
  Semaphores, which would be WAY too easy!  Implementing "non-fair"
  Semaphore semantics is straightforward, but implementing "fair"
  semantics is more complicated, so I recommend you apply the
  "Specific Notification" pattern described <A
  HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf">here</a>. <P>

</ul>

<H4>Compiling and Testing Your Program</H4>

To compile the provided skeleton code you need to use the provided
Eclipse project, which must be compiled using the Java 8 SDK.  There
is a Unit Test Suite that will run all the Unit test files included in
the test directory for you.  When you first open the project in
Eclipse, you might see compile errors if JUnit is not included in your
build path.  To fix these errors, open AllTests.java, hover over
"org.junit," and click "Fix project setup."  Make sure "Add JUnit 4
library to the build path" is selected and then click "OK."  At this
point, the compile errors should disappear!

Right click on the test suite (AllTests.java) or an individual
*_UnitTest.java file in Eclipse and select 'Run As' -> 'JUnit
Test'. When the assignment is complete, all the tests should complete
successfully.  If a test passes a green-check mark will appear next to
the test in the JUnit view.  As long as this JUnit test "passes"
successfully your program will be be consider "correct" for the
purposes of assessing this assignment.

<H4>Additional Work for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must do the following additional work:

<UL>

<LI> Implement the SimpleAtomicLong class using a Java StampLock,
which is covered in <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDAM2J44ZnE&index=22&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">this</A>
video.  Your solution needs to implement get() using an optimistic
read, incrementAndAdd() and decrementAndAdd() using a standard
writeLock, and getAndIncrement() and getAndDecrement() using a
conditional writeLock.  SimpleAtomicLong is used by the
SimpleAtomicLongUnitTest.java, but should not be used in the
SimpleSemaphore implementation itself. <P>

</UL>

Undergraduates are welcome to implement SimpleAtomicLong, as well.  If
you choose not to, however, simply implement SimpleAtomicLong by
defining an instance of the standard Java AtomicLong class and
forwarding the SimpleAtomicLong methods to the corresponding
AtomicLong methods. <P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment2/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using Eclipse and Java built-in monitor
objects (and Java StampedLock for students taking the class for
graduate credit).  It doesn't require any Android concurrency features
(or any Android at all), which we'll cover in future assignments.
