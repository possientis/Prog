<h3>Java Threads and Synchronizers (Assignment 1a)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment, you will use Java Thread, Runnable, Semaphore, and
AtomicLong classes, as well as Java synchronized statements, to
develop an Android app containing a resource manager that restricts
the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into
a fixed number of Palantiri.  If you're not yet a fan of Tolkein's
Lord of the Ring's trilogy, you can learn more about Palantiri <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">here</a>. <P>

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern.  The classes in the View layer are provided to you.
The main PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter various
configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and Beings.
It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the
Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's processing
logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the
Presenter and Model layers.  If you correctly implement these
skeletons the Palantiri app should run successfully without throwing
any exceptions. <P>

This Android application uses various features of Java Threads and
Runnables, which are described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY5E0o56gaw&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=12">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpEeZUjTiS4&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=13">here</a>.
You'll also need to understand how to use Java Semaphores and
synchronized statements, which are described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoaZTkot6-g&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=20">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3rcTTF45cA&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=25">here</a>,
respectively.  I recommend you watch these videos and look at the code
to ensure you understand how to program Java Threads and
synchronizers.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. <P>

<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  You'll need to modify several files containing the
skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You
fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of class methods defined by the
Presenter layer residing in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/presenter/PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE>.  In
particular, you'll need to (1) create/start a BeingThread for each
Being, which concurrently acquires a Palantir from the Model layer and
gazes into it for a certain amount of time and (2) start a thread to
wait for all the Being threads to finish and then inform the View
layer that the simulation is done. <P>

<LI> Finish the implementation of the Model layer in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/PalantiriManager.java</CODE>.  In
particular, you'll use a Java Semaphore, HashMap, and synchronized
statements to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources and
keep track of which Palantiri are currently free and which are in
use. <P>

</UL>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Eclipse ADT project
(you are also welcome to use Android Studio, but your solution must
work with Eclipse for the peer assessment phase).  You can run this
project by right-clicking the project's name in the Package Explorer
and selecting Run As -> Android Application. Eclipse ADT should
automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one
created. If you do not have one created you can create it by opening
Window -> Android Virtual Device Manager. <P>

The program will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes
a simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir, and Purple means the gazing was interrupted due to the lease
expiring.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Additional Work for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must do the following additional work:

<UL>

<LI> In the BeingRunnable class there are two unimplemented methods:
incrementGazingCountAndCheck() and decrementGazingCount().  You must
implement those functions as defined in the comments to double check
that the PalantirManager is properly limiting the number of threads
that have a Palantir using the Java AtomicLong. <P>

</UL>

Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods, but it's not
required.

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked. <P>

<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using an Android IDE and Java Threads, as well
as applying core Java synchronizers (such as Semaphore) and
synchronized statements to concurrently access collections (such as
HashMap) .  It doesn't require you to program any Android concurrency
or communication frameworks, which we'll cover in upcoming
assignments. <P>
