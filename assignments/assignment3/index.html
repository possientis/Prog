<h3>Java ExecutorService Framework and Java Synchronizers (Assignment 3)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

This two-part assignment will combine and extend elements of your <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">assignment
1</A> and <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">assignment
2</A> solutions.  In particular, you'll learn how to apply the Java
ExecutorService framework and a number of Java synchronizers to
complete an Android app containing a resource manager that restricts
the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into
a limited number of Palantiri. <P>

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern.  The classes in the <EM>View</EM> layer are provided to
you.  The main PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter
various configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and
Beings.  It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which
initializes the Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's
processing logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed
by the two MVP layers: the <EM>Presenter</EM> (which is the focus of
Part 1 of the assignment) and the <EM>Model</EM> (which is the focus
of Part 2 f the assignment).  If you correctly complete the
implementation of the skeletons in these layers the Palantiri app
should run successfully without throwing any exceptions. <P>

This Android app executes a BeingRunnable task for each Being using a
fixed-size ThreadPoolExecutor accessed via the Java ExecutorService
framework, which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAlvSkK9-k&index=27&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD8kTrnKH2Y&index=28&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>.
All these tasks will run concurrently and attempt to acquire a
Palantir and gaze into it for a certain amount of time.  You'll also
need to understand how to program with the following Java
synchronizers: 
<UL> 
<LI> Java ReentrantLock, which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW5YsMU1730&index=21&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>
<LI> ConditionObject, which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t9BOgQNkJ8&index=24&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>
<LI> and CyclicBarrier, which is described <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6LTKKTh_FA&index=25&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>.
</UL>

I recommend you watch these videos and look at the code to ensure you
understand how to program all these Java concurrency mechansims.
Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as well. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL> <LI> <A HREF="A3-Android-App">A3-Android-App</A>, which conains
the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</a>.  You'll need to import this project
into Eclipse as an Android app.

<LI> <A HREF="A3-Java-Test">A3-Java-Test</A>, which is a JUnit test
that exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to
help test the functionality created in Part 1 of the assignment.
You'll need to import this project into Eclipse as a Java app.

<LI> <A HREF="A3-Android-Test">A3-Android-Test</A>, which is a
Robotium test that runs your app automatically.  You'll need to have
both Part 1 and Part 2 implemented correctly for this test to work
properly.  You'll need to import this project into Eclipse as an
Android app.

</UL>

To compile the the A3-Android-App and A3-Android-Test you need to use
the provided Eclipse ADT projects.  You can run these project by
right-clicking the project's name in the Package Explorer and
selecting Run As -> Android Application for A3-Android-App and Run As
-> Android JUnit Test for A3-Android-Test.  Eclipse ADT should
automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one
created. If you do not have one created you can create it by opening
Window -> Android Virtual Device Manager. <P>

To compile the the A3-Java-Test you need to use the provided Eclipse
project.  You can run htis project by right-clicking the project's
name in the Package Explorer and selecting Run As -> JUnit Test. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4><A ??>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory of the A3-Android-App directory you'll find a
number of files, all of which you should read (and many of which are
similar to <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">assignment
1</A>).  You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton
Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in
here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE
OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You fill
in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <EM>Part 1</EM> -- Finish the implementation of class methods
defined by the Model layer's <CODE>PalantiriManager.java</CODE> and
<CODE>FairnessChecker.java</CODE> files in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/</CODE>.  In particular, you'll implement
the Specific Notification pattern, a HashMap, and the appropriate Java
synchronizers to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources
and keep track of which Palantiri are currently free and which are in
use.  You're welcome to reuse the SimpleSemaphore implementation from
assignment 2, though this code will need to be modified so that it
handles fairness properly, as we'll discuss in class.  You can test
Part 1 using the A3-Java-Test JUnit test described above. <P>

<LI> <EM>Part 2</EM> -- Finish the implementation of class methods
defined by the Presenter layer's <CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE>
and <CODE>BeingRunnable.java</CODE> files in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/presenter</CODE>.  In particular, you'll need to
(1) use the Java ExecutorService to create/start a BeingRunnable task
for each Being, which concurrently acquires a Palantir from the Model
layer and gazes into it for a certain amount of time and (2) start a
thread that uses CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier objects to
coordinate the beginning and ending of the simulation and then inform
the View layer that the simulation is done.  You can test Part 2 using
the A3-Android-Test Robotium test described above. <P>

</UL>

The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir, and Purple means the gazing was interrupted due to the lease
expiring.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

There is a fairness checker built into the UI that checks to ensure
that the PalantiriManager is "fair," i.e., the thread waiting for a
Palantir the longest is the first to receive the next available
Palantir.  It proper functioning depends upon you to correctly employ
the FairnessChecker class methods into your PalantiriManager
implementation.  If the FairnessChecker detects that the
PalantirManager is acting unfairly, it calls back to turn the "Fair"
icon yellow. <P>

<H4>Additional Work for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or any student who is taking this course for
graduate credit) must do the following additional work:

<UL>

<LI> <EM>Part 1</EM> -- Implement the synchronization needed to
protect shared fields within the PalantiriManager using a
ReentrantReadWriteLock, which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDAM2J44ZnE&index=22&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>.
Undergraduates can optionally use a ReentrantReadWriteLock or they can
simply use a ReentrantLock.

<LI> <EM>Part 2</EM> -- Implement an exit barrier using a
CountDownLatch, which is described <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDAM2J44ZnE&index=22&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">here</a>.
</UL>

The additional work required by graduate students is clearly marked in
the skeletons.

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

The skeleton code for both parts of this assignment is available from
my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This two-part assignment is designed to deepen your knowledge of
multi-threaded programs using Eclipse and Eclipse ADT, the Java
ExecutorService framework, and various Java synchronizers.  It doesn't
require any Android concurrency frameworks, which we'll cover in
upcoming assignments.  However, the synchronization challenges are
more complicated than the earlier assignments, which is why the
assignment is split into two parts.  I recommend starting early and
asking questions if you run into problems. <P>
