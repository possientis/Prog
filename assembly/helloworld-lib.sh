# linking can be done with the usual 'ld' or with 'gcc'
# however, gcc linking seems to require the entry point to be 'main'
# rather than '_start'. As can be seen, gcc linking is a lot easier

# ld syntax is explained as follows:
# -m elf_i386 -> creating 32 bit elf executable
# -e main     -> entry point called 'main' rather than '_start' 
# -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2  -> library (printf, exit see below)
# -lc         -> also necessary in order to link to C library (see below)
# -o helloworld-lib -> name of output executable file

#The option -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 allows our program to be linked to
#libraries. This builds the executable so that before executing, the operating system will load the
#program /lib/ld-linux.so.2 to load in external libraries and link them with the program.
#This program is known as a dynamic linker.
#The -lc option says to link to the c library, named libc.so on GNU/Linux systems. Given a
#library name, c in this case (usually library names are longer than a single letter), the GNU/Linux
#linker prepends the string lib to the beginning of the library name and appends .so to the end of
#it to form the libraryâ€™s filename. This library contains many functions to automate all types of
#tasks. The two we are using are printf , which prints strings, and exit , which exits the program.
