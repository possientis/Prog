In this section we define the {\em quotient universal algebra $[X]$
of type $\alpha$} derived from a universal algebra $X$ of type
$\alpha$ and a congruence $\sim$ on $X$. Given $x\in X$, we shall
denote $[x]$ the {\em equivalent class of $x$ modulo $\sim$},
namely:
    \[
    [x]=\{y\in X:x\sim y\}
    \]
Note that $[x]=[y]$ is equivalent to $x\sim y$ for all $x,y\in X$.
Given $f\in\alpha$ and $x\in X^{\alpha(f)}$, $[x]$ to denote the
element of $[X]^{\alpha(f)}$ defined by $[x](i)=[x(i)]$.

\begin{theorem}\label{logic:the:quotient}
Let $X$ be a universal algebra of type $\alpha$ and $\sim$ be a
congruence on~$X$. Given $x\in X$, let $[x]$ denote the equivalence
class of $x$ modulo $\sim$ and $[X]$ be the quotient set $[X] =
\{[x]:x\in X\}$. Let $\pi:X\to[X]$ be defined by $\pi(x)=[x]$ for
all $x\in X$. Then, there exists a unique structure of universal
algebra of type $\alpha$ on $[X]$ such that $\pi$ is a surjective
morphism. Furthermore:
    \begin{equation}\label{logic:eqn:quotient}
    \forall x\in X^{\alpha(f)}\ ,\ f([x]) = [f(x)]
    \end{equation}
for all $f\in\alpha$. This structure is called the {\em quotient
structure on $[X]$}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Note that given $f\in\alpha$ and $x\in X^{\alpha(f)}$, $[x]$ refers
to the element of $[X]^{\alpha(f)}$ defined by $[x](i)=[x(i)]$ for
all $i\in\alpha(f)$, being understood that $[x]=0$ is $\alpha(f)=0$.
It follows that equation~(\ref{logic:eqn:quotient}) is meaningful.
Note also that $\pi:X\to [X]$ is a surjective map, regardless of any
structure on $[X]$. We shall first prove the existence of a
structure of universal algebra of type $\alpha$ on $[X]$ which makes
$\pi:X\to[X]$ into a morphism. We need to show the existence of a
map $T$ with domain $\alpha$ such that $T(f):[X]^{\alpha(f)}\to[X]$
for all $f\in\alpha$ and:
    \begin{equation}\label{logic:eqn:quotient:morphism}
    \forall x\in X^{\alpha(f)}\ ,\ \pi\circ f(x) = T(f)\circ\pi(x)
    \end{equation}
So let $f\in\alpha$. We need to define some
$T(f):[X]^{\alpha(f)}\to[X]$. Let $x^{*}\in[X]^{\alpha(f)}$. We need
to define $T(f)(x*)$. First we shall show that there exists $x\in
X^{\alpha(f)}$ such that $x^{*}=[x]$. Indeed, for all
$i\in\alpha(f)$, $x^{*}(i)$ is an element of $[X]$. So there exists
$x_{i}\in X$ such that $x^{*}(i)=[x_{i}]$. Define $x\in
X^{\alpha(f)}$ by setting $x(i)=x_{i}$ for all $i\in\alpha(f)$,
being understood that $x=0$ if $\alpha(f)=0$. Then, for all
$i\in\alpha(f)$ we have $[x](i)=[x(i)]=[x_{i}]=x^{*}(i)$ and it
follows that $[x]=x^{*}$. We now define $T(f)(x^{*})=[f(x)]$. We
need to check that this definition is valid, namely that $[f(x)]$ is
independent of the particular $x\in X^{\alpha(f)}$ such that
$x^{*}=[x]$. So suppose that $x,y\in X^{\alpha(f)}$ such that
$[x]=[y]$. We need to show that $[f(x)]=[f(y)]$ or equivalently that
$f(x)\sim f(y)$. Since $\sim$ is a congruence, this will be achieved
by showing that $x\sim y$ or equivalently that $x(i)\sim y(i)$ for
all $i\in\alpha(f)$. However, $[x]=[y]$ and it follows that
$[x(i)]=[x](i)=[y](i)=[y(i)]$ for all $i\in\alpha(f)$ from which we
obtain $x(i)\sim y(i)$. So we have proved that $T(f)(x^{*})$ is well
defined. Furthermore since $T(f)(x^{*})=[f(x)]$, we have
$T(f)(x^{*})\in [X]$. Hence we have successfully defined
$T(f):[X]^{\alpha(f)}\to[X]$ for all $f\in\alpha$. It follows that
the ordered pair $([X],T)$ is a universal algebra of type $\alpha$.
it remains to check that $\pi:X\to[X]$ is a morphism under this
particular structure, i.e. that
equation~(\ref{logic:eqn:quotient:morphism}) is satisfied for all
$f\in\alpha$. So let $x\in X^{\alpha(f)}$ and $x^{*}=[x]$. We have:
    \[
    \pi\circ f(x)=[f(x)]=T(f)(x^{*})=T(f)([x])=T(f)\circ\pi(x)
    \]
This completes our proof of the existence of a structure of
universal algebra of type $\alpha$ on $[X]$ such that $\pi:X\to[X]$
is a surjective morphism. We shall now prove the uniqueness. So
suppose $S$ is another map with domain $\alpha$ such that
$S(f):[X]^{\alpha(f)}\to[X]$ for all $f\in\alpha$ with respect to
which $\pi$ is a morphism. We need to show that $S=T$. So let
$f\in\alpha$. We need to show that $S(f)=T(f)$. So let
$x^{*}\in[X]^{\alpha(f)}$. We need to show that
$S(f)(x^{*})=T(f)(x^{*})$. Let $x\in X^{\alpha(f)}$ be such that
$x^{*}=[x]$. Since $\pi$ is a morphism under $S$ we obtain:
    \[
    S(f)(x^{*})=S(f)([x])=S(f)\circ\pi(x)=\pi\circ f(x)=[f(x)]=T(f)(x^{*})
    \]
We shall complete the proof of the theorem by showing that
equation~(\ref{logic:eqn:quotient}) holds for all $f\in\alpha$. So
let $x\in X^{\alpha(f)}$. We need to show that $f([x])=[f(x)]$. But
this follows immediately from $T(f)([x])=[f(x)]$ and the fact that
'$f([x])$' is a notational shortcut for '$T(f)([x])$'.
\end{proof}
