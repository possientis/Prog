(February 25, 2012, 2:07 pm)</p><p>OmegaForte: My EARS are screaming for mercy, I wanted FREE BIRD. Not this crap. (February 25, 2012, 7:08 pm)</p><p>&lt;&gt;: fak juu, Haibane Renmei Free Bird is awesome! Though the song would more powerful in different context. (February 25, 2012, 8:03 pm)</p><p>PenZon: Why am I not hearing Lynyrd Skynyrd? (February 26, 2012, 12:33 pm)</p><p>Bob: Why are you people so fanatic about Lynyrd Skynyrds Free Bird? It&#039;s essentially 80&#039;s version of the Rickroll meme. 

Kevin Matthews, a Chicago radio host in the 80&#039;s told his fans to yell &quot;Free Bird&quot; in bad concerts to mock the artist. Too bad the meme got so popular that people were yelling it in every possible concert... To quote Matthews: &quot;It was never meant to be yelled at a cool concert -- it was meant to be yelled at someone really lame,&quot; he says. &quot;If you&#039;re going to yell &#039;Freebird,&#039; yell &#039;Freebird&#039; at a Jim Nabors concert.&quot; (February 26, 2012, 2:31 pm)</p><p>TROU: Yelling out &quot;Freebird&quot; at bad concerts was a meme (apparently), but the song is amazing, and extremely famous, so choosing the same title for another song is retarded.

Some other song titles that are already taken:
- Thriller
- I want to break free
- We are the champions
- etc. 
- etc.

If some random shitty band has made a song called &quot;Ham&quot;, then one might use the same title as that claim is weak, since the song is bad, but for amazing songs it&#039;s stupid — and in this case we also feel trolled since we expected [u]Freebird[/u], and not &quot;Freebird&quot; by Random Jap Composers. 

Regardless of our expectations, this song is pretty boring. Someone needs to make a good loop of Freebird.

<h3>Tags ( Loop ) for free_bird.swf :</h3>
            <h2><a href="/flash/?filter=loop">Loops</a></h2>
      <p>free_bird.swf is a short looping flash. A loop is generally something that closes back on itself such as a circle or ring. Our fruity loops are usually from  anime or other funny videos. Most of loops are from anime and I don't think there will ever be too much anime in the world. Anime loops are just short clips but most of them have too fitting music. Check comments for info.<br />
        free_bird.swf Loop Flash was a small trend on the Internet that got killed by being overdone. Loops are short bits that keeps on repeating. No storyline to follow, no need to look closely or catch something that will go away. These Flash are on repeat.<br />
        free_bird.swf Flash animations are typically distributed by way of the WWW, in which case they are often referred to as Internet cartoons, online cartoons, or webtoons.<br />
      Animation is the rapid display of a sequence of images of 2-D or 3-D artwork or model positions in order to create an illusion of movement. It is an optical illusion of motion due to the phenomenon of persistence of vision, and can be created and demonstrated in a number of ways. The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program, although several other forms of presenting animation also exist.<br />
      Traditional animation was and is the process used for most animated films of the 20'h century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, which are first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. free_bird.swf The animators drawings are traced onto transparent acetate sheets called cels, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one onto motion picture film against a painted background by a rostrum camera.<br />
      A good laugh can definitely make a girl cuter. This girl's laugh makes the guys around her wonder whether or not she is on mind-altering substances.</p>

              <p>There is addicting action games, multiplayer arcade games, thrilling adventure games and some card games on this site. Ah.. I forgot... There is also asian games that looks weird for western people. Most of them are really addicting games so be prepared to spend a lot of time with them.<br />
      There are many types or genres of flash gamse. To name just few of them: role-playing games, shooters, first-person shooters and platformers. Online games can be played with your browser without installing them to your own computer. You don't need to install anything to play them. Online gaming is a technology rather than a genre; a mechanism for connecting players together rather than a particular pattern of gameplay. Flash allows a much higher level of complexity in on-line games than some html5 variants. Thats why flash games are not going to disappear in the near future. Flash allows players to use a wide variety of weapons and objects, and can supply much more detailed maps and settings.<br />
      As consoles are becoming more like personal computers, online gameplay is expanding to other multimedia devices. The first online game console was the Super Famicom, which offered an online service with the Satellaview. This service was however offered only in Japan. Once online games started crowding the market, open source networks, such as the PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube took advantage of online functionality with its PC game counterpart. Games such as Phantasy Star Online have private servers that function on multiple consoles. Dreamcast, PC, Macintosh and GameCube players are able to share one server. Earlier games, like 4x4 Evolution, Quake III and Need for Speed: Underground also have a similar function with consoles able to interact with PC users using the same server. Usually, a company like Electronic Arts or Sega runs the servers until it becomes inactive, in which private servers with their own DNS number can function. This form of open source networking has a small advantage over the new generation of Sony and Microsoft consoles which customize their servers to the consumer. Nowaydays all consoles (PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, OnLive, Gizmondo, Wii) are able to connect to internet and play online games or play online against each other. </p>
